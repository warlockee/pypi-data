When they wanted to put their assets to good use, data owners had to open unrestricted access to their dataset, often through a Jupyter notebook. This was dangerous because too many operations were allowed and the data scientist had numerous ways to extract information from the remote infrastructure (print the whole database, save the dataset in the weights, etc). \n\nThat is why we built BastionLab with the aim to ensure privacy while fitting easily in the whole data science workflow of both data owners and data scientists.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Quick tour\n\nYou can go try out our [Quick tour](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/tree/master/docs/docs/quick-tour/quick-tour.ipynb) in the documentation to discover BastionLab with a hands-on example using the famous Titanic dataset.\n\nBut here\u2019s a taste of what using BastionLab could look like \ud83c\udf52\n\n### Data Owner's side\n```py\nfrom bastionlab import Connection\nimport polars as pl\n\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"titanic.csv\")\n\nwith Connection(\"bastionlab.example.com\") as client:\n    client.polars.send_df(df)\n```\n\n### Data Scientist's side\n```py\nfrom bastionlab import Connection\n\nwith Connection(\"bastionlab.example.com\") as client:\n    all_remote_dfs = client.polars.list_dfs()\n    remote_df = all_remote_dfs[0]\n    remote_df.head(5).collect().fetch()\n```\n\n## \ud83d\udc40 What is this wheel\n\nThis wheel was made to deploy very easily BastionLab's server on a Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook environments.\n\n**Please remember that while you will have most of the functionality of BastionLab, this wheel was not made to be used in production environments. If you want to personalize more the server and get the security features, it is recommanded to deploy the server yourself. Please refer to the documentation for more information.**\n\n## \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f Key Features\n\n- **Access control**: data owners can define an interactive privacy policy that will filter the data scientist queries. They do not have to open unrestricted access to their datasets anymore. \n- **Limited expressivity**: BastionLab limits the type of operations that can be executed by the data scientists to avoid arbitrary code execution.\n- **Transparent remote access**: the data scientists never access the dataset directly. They only manipulate a local object that contains metadata to interact with a remotely hosted dataset. Calls can always be seen by data owners.\n\n## \ud83d\ude4b Getting Help\n\n- Go to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TxEHagpWd4) #support channel\n- Report bugs by [opening an issue on our BastionLab Github](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionlab/issues)\n- [Book a meeting](https://calendly.com/contact-mithril-security/15mins?month=2022-11) with us\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Disclaimer\n\nBastionLab is still in development. **Do not use it yet in a production workload.** We will audit our solution in the future to attest that it enforces the security standards of the market. \n\n## \ud83d\udcdd License\n\nBastionLab is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\n*Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.* \n\n*[See the License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.*\n",
