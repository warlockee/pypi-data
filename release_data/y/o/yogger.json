This name is used to identify which frames to dump in the stack. So it\u2019s important what you provide there. If you are using a single module, `__name__` is always the correct value. If you are using a package, it\u2019s usually recommended to hardcode the name of your package there.\n\nFor example, if your application is defined in \"yourapplication/app.py\", you should create it with one of the two versions below:\n\n```python\nyogger.configure(\"yourapplication\")\n```\n\n```python\nyogger.configure(__name__.split(\".\")[0])\n```\n\nWhy is that? The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks to how resources are looked up. However, it will make debugging more painful. Yogger makes assumptions based on the import name of your application. If the import name is not properly set up, that debugging information may be lost.\n\n## Support for dumping the stack\n\n### Traces and exceptions\n\nUsing the `dump_on_exception` **context manager** dumps the exception and trace if an exception is raised:\n\n```python\nwith yogger.dump_on_exception(\n    # Uncomment to override\n    # dump_path=\"./stack_dump.txt\",\n):\n    raise SomeException\n```\n\nThis is nearly equivalent to:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n```\n\n```python\ntry:\n    raise SomeException\nexcept Exception as e:\n    trace = inspect.trace()\n    if len(trace) > 1:\n        with open(\"./stack_dump.txt\", mode=\"a\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n            yogger.dump(f, trace[1:], e=e, package_name=\"yourapplication\")\n```\n\n### Stacks\n\nSetting `dump_locals=True` when running `yogger.configure` dumps a representation of the caller's stack upon logging with a level of warning or higher.\n\nTo manually dump the stack, something like this would suffice:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n```\n\n```python\nstack = inspect.stack()\nif len(stack) > 2:\n    with open(\"./example.log\", mode=\"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as fp:\n        yogger.dump(fp, stack[2:][::-1])\n```\n\nIf you simply want the string representation, use the `yogger.dumps` function:\n\n```python\nstack = inspect.stack()\nif len(stack) > 2:\n    trace_repr = yogger.dumps(stack[2:][::-1])\n```\n\n---\n\n## Library\n\n### yogger.install\n\nFunction to install the logger class and instantiate the global logger.\n\n| Function Signature |\n|
