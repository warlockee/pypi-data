Doing this is covered in [this\nreadme](https://pypi.org/project/mapel/). The extra dependencies contain:  \n```\ncplex>=20.1.0.1\npulp~=2.5.1\nabcvoting~=2.0.0b0\npermanent\n```  \nwhich unlock approval based committee rules (which require solving I(L)P\nprograms) and sampling a matrix using a permanent-based approach.\n\nOne can do it by invoking  \n`pip install mapel-elections[extras]`\n\n> :exclamation: Note that this library contains C++ extensions. So installing\n  this library from sources  might be a bit cumbersome. We will, one day, put\n  here an instruction how to do it.\n\n## Testing Installation\n\nIf the instalation was successfull, you should be able to mimic the following:  \n\n```\n(<virtual_envirnonment_name>) $ python\n...\n>>> import mapel.elections.metrics.cppdistances as d\n...\n>>> d.swapd([[0,1,2],[0,1,2]], [[0,1,2],[2,1,0]])\n3\n>>> exit()\n```\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis project is part of the [PRAGMA project](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pragma/)\nwhich has received funding from the [European Research Council\n(ERC)](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~pragma/) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020\nresearch and innovation programme ([grant agreement No\n101002854](https://erc.easme-web.eu/?p=101002854)).\n\n\n\n",
