Of course, considering the support for the older versions of Windows without Edge, you can install Google Chrome on your computer.\n- In MacOS, you need to install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) / [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) or Chromium.\n- In Linux, you can choose to install any of the Google Chrome / Chromium / Microsoft Edge browsers. It is recommended to install Chromium. The name of this software package in your Linux distribution is commonly `chromium` or `chromium-browser` (Note: for Ubuntu later than 18.04, you have to install `chromium-browser` through `snap`).\n\nMake sure the following exists in your `book.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[output.html]\n\n[output.pdf]\n```\n\nAnd also `[output.html.print]` is not disabled (it should be enabled by default, so don't worry if the following lines doesn't occur in you `book.toml`).\n\n```toml\n[output.html.print]\nenable = true\n```\n\nA simplest `book.toml` is as follows:\n\n```toml\n[book]\ntitle = \"An Example\"\n\n[output.html]\n\n[output.pdf]\n```\n\nFinally you can build your book and get the PDF file with `mdbook build` command, your PDF file will be available at `book/pdf/output.pdf`.\n\n## Configuration\nSupport customize PDF paper orientation, scale of the webpage rendering, paper width and height, page margins, generated PDF page ranges, whether to display header and footer as well as customize their formats, and more.\n\nCheck [book.toml](test_doc/book.toml#L10-L35) and comments for details for the available configurations of `[output.pdf]`.\n\n## Common Issues\n1. Support for Firefox in `mdbook-pdf`!\n\nCurrently, according to [Puppeteer's documentation](https://pptr.dev/#?product=Puppeteer&show=api-pagepdfoptions), [Chrome DevTools Protocol Page.printToPDF](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page/#method-printToPDF) is only supported in Chrome headless. An issue has already been filed for this [here](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7628).\n\n2. Broken links!\n\nI've already submitted [a PR for mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1738) to fix this by making print page (print.html) links link to anchors on the print page, but it's not merged yet. You can try [my PR fork](https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdBook) for this to work.\n\nIf you have relative links that link outside the book, please provide the [static hosting site URL](test_doc/book.toml#L17-L18) for it to get fixed.\n\n3. Can you add the bookmark to the PDF reflecting the Table of Contents, just like what [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) supported?\n\nThis should be realized by Chromium, and an issue has already been filed for this [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=781797).\n\nInitial support for the bookmark/outline of the PDF file has already been available ([mdbook-pdf-outline](https://pypi.org/project/mdbook-pdf-outline/)). It is written in Python and is another backend for `mdbook` and should be used with `mdbook-pdf` and the [mdbook version](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/pull/1738) mentioned in Common Issues 2 for fixing the broken links in `print.html`.\n\nYou can install this backend by `pip install mdbook-pdf-outline`.\n\nRemember to put the following to ***the end of*** your `book.toml`, ***after [output.pdf]***:\n\n```toml\n[output.pdf-outline]\n```\n\nIf you want to use the table of content just like the one shown in the `print.html` page for PDF file, you can leave the `book.toml` as it is.\n\nIf you prefer to use the table of content just like the one generated by `wkhtmltopdf` (generate entries based on the headings), you can turn on the `like-wkhtmltopdf` option by using the following to your `book.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[output.pdf-outline]\nlike-wkhtmltopdf = true\n```\n\nFinally, you can find the outlined version at `book/pdf-outline/output.pdf`.\n\n4. Failed to render my book for PDF in `mdbook-pdf`!\n\nWill appreciate if you can report it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdbook-pdf/issues/new) providing all the traces for `mdbook-pdf` rendering.\n\n```bash\nRUST_BACKTRACE=full RUST_LOG=trace mdbook build\n```\n## Credits\nThis project relies on [headless_chrome](https://github.com/atroche/rust-headless-chrome). Because the new version has not been released, and the default timeout is not friendly to PDF generation, I use my [Fork version](https://github.com/HollowMan6/rust-headless-chrome) to published [mdbook-pdf-headless_chrome](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-pdf-headless_chrome) for expanding the relevant timeout to 600 seconds as a submodule of this project, thus enabling the project to be published on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) as well.\n",
