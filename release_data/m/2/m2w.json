It's OK if you just use m2w 1.0, and It works very well.\n\n\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\\=\n\nNow, more powerful `m2w 2` comes and meet everyone! :star2: :star2: :star2:\n\n`m2w 2` has these features: \n\n+ Use `config/user.json` to maintain the user information in a little different way comparing with `m2w 1.0`.\n+ You can just keep your file structures locally as you like.\n+ You can manage lots of websites at the same time via multiple `legacy_*.json`.\n+ All you need to deal with is a single python script `m2w.py` instead of two (`update.py` and `upload.py` in `m2w 1.0`).\n+ Ignore repeated new markdown files for uploading (`v2.2.4+`)\n+ Stable and useful as `m2w 1.0`.\n\n## Install\n\nHere is the dependency: \n\n```python\ninstall_requires=[\n\t\"python-frontmatter>=1.0.0\", \n    \"markdown>=3.3.1\", \n    \"python-wordpress-xmlrpc>=2.3\"\n]\npython_requires='>=3.10'\n```\n\nAfter 2022-12-10, `m2w 2` was uploaded onto [PyPi](https://pypi.org). To install `m2w 2`, just run `pip install m2w ` in your shell:\n\n![Code_z5stuj9RSj](https://chevereto.hwb0307.com/images/2022/12/10/Code_z5stuj9RSj.gif)\n\nYou can also directly download `m2w 2`  from this repotory. The usage is exactly the same.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n+ Install m2w from PyPi or this Github repotory. \n+ Build a `m2w.py` file in `<path01>`. Here is the [demo](https://github.com/huangwb8/m2w/blob/main/m2w.py). Set `path_m2w` where there is a file `/config/user.json`.\n\n```python\npath_m2w = <a path defined by yourself>\n```\n\n+ Define the `/config/user.json`.  you can add many websites like `web01`!  Please go to the [demo](https://github.com/huangwb8/m2w/blob/main/config/user.json) for more details. Here is some interpretations: \n  + **domain, username, password**:  The information of your WordPress site and account.\n  + **path_markdown**: Add as much top folders as you want! \n  + **post_metadata**: Default category information. \n  + **websites**: Add as much accounts as you want! \n  + **path_legacy_json**: Just leave it alone and do not change anything!\n\n\n```json\n\"web01\": {\n        \"domain\": \"https://domain-01.com\",\n        \"username\": \"username-01\",\n        \"password\": \"password-01\",\n        \"path_markdown\": [\n            \"E:/Github/m2w/@test/main\",\n            \"E:/Github/m2w/@test/main2\"\n        ],\n        \"post_metadata\": {\n            \"category\": [\"test\"],\n            \"tag\": [\"test\"],\n            \"status\": \"publish\"\n        },\n        \"path_legacy_json\": \"/config/legacy\"\n    }\n```\n\n+ Run `m2w.py` like: \n\n```bash\npython3 <path01>/m2w.py\n```\n\n## Demo\n\n### Update\n\n![Code_gRt7iyCPOh](https://chevereto.hwb0307.com/images/2022/12/03/Code_gRt7iyCPOh.gif)\n\n### Upload\n\n![Code_FO6ElypOTt](https://chevereto.hwb0307.com/images/2022/12/03/Code_FO6ElypOTt.gif)\n\n## LOG\n\n+ **2022-12-10** \uff1aUpload `m2w 2` to PyPi. You can install `m2w 2` with code (in Shell)  like `pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple m2w`. The project url is [https://pypi.org/project/m2w](https://pypi.org/project/m2w).\n+ **2022-12-08** \uff1aIgnore repeated uploading of new markdown based on their file names. Update ot `m2w 2.2.4` (Strongly recommended)! \n+ **2022-12-06**\uff1aOptimized parameter space of m2w, which make it more flexible. Update ot `m2w 2.2`!\n+ **2022-12-03**\uff1aBrand-new m2w 2.0!\n+ **2022-11-13**\uff1aAdd error control for the `Client` function, which is helpful to avoid legacy bugs if the connection to the WordPress website is not available.\n+ **Before**: Create `m2w` project.\n\n## TO-DO\n\n+ Nothing\n\n## Related Efforts\n\n- [nefu-ljw/python-markdown-to-wordpress](https://github.com/nefu-ljw/python-markdown-to-wordpress)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[@huangwb8](https://t.me/hwb0307)\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to dive in!
