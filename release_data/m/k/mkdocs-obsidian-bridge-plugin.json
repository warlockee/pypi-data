            "description": "# [Obsidian][obsidian] \u27a1\ufe0f [MkDocs][mkdocs] Bridge\n\nAn MkDocs plugin that helps exporting your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault as an MkDocs site.\n\n## What it does\n\nI began writing this plugin to simplify exporting my Obsidian vault to GitHub Pages using MkDocs. The plugin is still in development since there are a lot more features that could possibly be implemented, however, currently it has the following features:\n\n- Auto-expand incomplete [Markdown links](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Links)\n- Auto-expand incomplete [Obsidian's internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link)\n- Detect and mark invalid links (to style them differently)\n\n### Auto-expanding incomplete links\n\nBy auto-expanding I mean that you don't need to write a full path to the page you are linking to (exactly like in [Obsidian][obsidian]). Consider the following folder structure:\n\n```\ndocs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 2021/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Books.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Games.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 2022/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Sport.md\n```\n\nIf you are editing `Sport.md`, you could write:\n```md\n[Books](../2021/Books.md)\n```\nbut with this plugin you can just drop the path:\n```md\n[Books](Books.md)\n```\nor even write the [Obsidian][obsidian] way:\n```md\n[[Books]]\n```\n\n#### Name clashes\n\nWhat if you have `Books.md` in both 2021 and 2022?\n\n```\ndocs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 2021/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Books.md\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 Games.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 2022/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 Books.md\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 Sport.md\n```\n\nBy default, the plugin tried to find the shortest relative path (again, like [Obsidian][obsidian]), e.g.\n```md\n[[Books]]\n```\nis translated into:\n```md\n[Books](./Books.md)\n```\n\nBut you can also give the resolver _a hint_ by specifying the path **partially:**\n```md\n[[2021/Books]]\n```\nor\n```md\n[Books](2021/Books.md)\n```\n\nBoth variants work equivalently.\n\n## How to enable\n\nInstall the plugin with:\n\n```sh\npip install mkdocs-obsidian-bridge-plugin\n```\n\nThe plugin depends on some features of Python 3.10, so this is the minimum required version.\n\nThen you can enable it in your `mkdocs.yml` config:\n\n```yaml\nplugins:\n  - obsidian-bridge\n```\n\n## Why one more plugin?\n\nI wouldn't ever write this one if I could achieve what I need with other ones. Maybe, I just couldn't find the solution, but here we are.\n\n### Differences to [Autolinks Plugin](https://github.com/zachhannum/mkdocs-autolinks-plugin)\n\n1. **Autolinks Plugin** doesn't try to resolve the shortest path out of the list of potential candidates.\n2. It also doesn't support incomplete relative paths. In other words, it works only with file names.\n\n### Differences to [Roamlinks Plugin](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/mkdocs-roamlinks-plugin)\n\n1. As well as **Autolinks Plugin**, the **Roamlinks Plugin** does not try to match the best path if there several of those, does it?\n2. Also, in case it can't resolve the `[[Roam link]]`, it leaves it as a text, while [**Obsidian Bridge**](https://github.com/GooRoo/mkdocs-obsidian-bridge-plugin) still transforms it into the Markdown link although invalid one. (This one, actually, was the reason why I started developing my own plugin in the first place).\n\n### Differences to [WikiLinks](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/wikilinks/) extension for [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/)\n\n1. I haven't tried this one, but it looks like **WikiLinks** is unable to automatically resolve paths at all without an additional (and a bit cumbersome) config.\n2. Also, not sure if it supports all the [Obsidian][obsidian]'s features.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced topics\n\n### Styling of invalid links\n\n<details>\n  <summary>See for yourself!</summary>\n\n\nThe plugin translates [Obsidian][obsidian]-style `[[internal links]]` to markdown `[internal links](internal%20links)` even if the resulting link is invalid. If you want to distinguish such links from the rest, you can assign them a custom CSS style.\n\nIn order to do that, you should add an `invalid_link_attributes` config option to your `mkdocs.yml` **AND** enable the `attr_list` Markdown extension:\n\n```yaml\nmarkdown_extensions:\n  - attr_list\n\nplugins:\n  - obsidian-bridge:\n      invalid_link_attributes:\n        - '.invalid'\n\nextra_css:\n  - stylesheets/extra.css\n```\n\nThe `.invalid` in this example translates to `class=\"invalid\"` HTML attribute accordingly to the rules of [**Attribute Lists**](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/) extension.\n\nAfter that, you can extend `extra.css` with some style (just don't forget to add `extra_css` property to your `mkdocs.yml` too as above):\n\n```css\na.invalid {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if your style is going to be simple, you can just write it in the attribute itself as following:\n\n```yaml\nmarkdown_extensions:\n  - attr_list\n\nplugins:\n  - obsidian-bridge:\n      invalid_link_attributes:\n        - 'style=\"color: red\"'\n```\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## What's next\n\nMy current preliminary roadmap is the following:\n\n- [ ] Obsidian's [**callouts**](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts) \u27a1\ufe0f MkDocs's [**admonitions**](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/)\n- [ ] Support for Obsidian's [**nested tags**](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Tags#Nested+tags)\n- [ ] Obsidian's [**comments**](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Comments) `%% ... %%` \u27a1\ufe0f HTML comments `<!-- ... -->`\n\nI give no guarantees about the deadlines or whether I implement anything at all. I do it for myself and currently I do see a need, so probably I'll continue.\n\n### Feedback\n\nI do appreciate any kind of constructive feedback.\n\n* If you found a bug, please, [report it](https://github.com/GooRoo/mkdocs-obsidian-bridge-plugin/issues/new).\n* If you want to request a feature, please, [post an idea](https://github.com/GooRoo/mkdocs-obsidian-bridge-plugin/discussions/new?category=Ideas).\n* In all other cases, don't hesitate to [start a discussion](https://github.com/GooRoo/mkdocs-obsidian-bridge-plugin/discussions/new).\n\n\n[mkdocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org\n[obsidian]: https://obsidian.md\n",
