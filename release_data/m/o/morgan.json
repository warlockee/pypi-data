Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n        \n           7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n        \n           7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n        \n           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n        \n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n        \n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n        \n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n              replaced with your own identifying information.
