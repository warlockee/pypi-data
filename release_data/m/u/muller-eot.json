M\u00fcller implementation of the \"Equation of Time - Problem in Astronomy\"](http://info.ifpan.edu.pl/firststep/aw-works/fsII/mul/mueller.pdf) to calculate EOT and the effect of eccentricity/obliquity\n\nThe combined effect of eccentricity and obliquity create the Equation of Time components. This package uses M\u00fcller implementation to allow for the components to be graphed seperately as well as the final EOT\n\n| Effect of Eccentricity | Effect of Obliquity |\n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| ![effect_eccentricity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyschneck/Muller-EOT/main/examples/earth_eccentricity_testing.png) | ![effect_obliquity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyschneck/Muller-EOT/main/examples/earth_obliquity_testing.png) |\n\n![effect_eot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyschneck/Muller-EOT/main/examples/earth_eot_testing.png)\n\n## Overview\n\nThere are only four times of year where the length of the day is almost exactly 24 hours. \nThe rest of the year when the sun is at its highest point (solar noon), a clock can run \nas much as 16 minutes ahead (12:16pm) or 13 minutes behind (11:47am). This discrepency is \nthe result of combined effect of a planet's obliquity (axial tilt) and its eccentricity (as\nwell as other smaller gravitional forces like moons that are ignored here). Both of thsee \nfeatures form two sine curves that oscillate throughout the year. The combined sum\nof these two curves form the Equation of Time, a non-uniform change in time to fix to a clock.\nA planet with an obliquity of 0\u00b0 and perfectly circular orbit (zero eccentricity) would have\nno difference in the Expected Solar Noon and the Actual Solar Noon.\n\nEquation of Time = (Apparent Solar Time) - (Mean Solar Time) \n\n**Effect of Eccentricity:**\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203484492-bf0f6098-fe13-44d3-b372-bcb8cc4120f8.png\" />\n</p>\n\n**Effect of Obliquity:**\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203484389-613ffb3e-9719-4962-a316-eeeb887af1c5.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\"Equation of time is determined by the following parameters: the eccentricity of \nthe orbit of the Earth, the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial planes, the \nangle P between the winter solstice and the perihelion relative to the sun or: \nthe time span \u2206t from the beginning of winter to the passage through periehlion\" (M\u00fcller, 1995)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203484797-23c81e99-0eee-4431-bc21-31429a615e4f.png\" />\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203484692-b07bad99-3c6c-43e5-904f-04200f72c571.png\" />\n</p>\n\nThe effect of obliquity and eccentricity are the caused as a result of Kepler's law:\n\n\"Two well-known features of our solar system are at the basis of the variations\n in the apparent motion of the sun: 1.) According to Kepler's second law, the angular\n velocity of the Earth relative to the sun varies throughout a year. 2) Equal angles\n which the sun in its apparent movement goes through in the eclipitic do not correspond\n to equal angles we measure on the equatorial plane. However, it is these latter angles\n which are relevant for the measure of time, since the daily movement of the sun is\n parallel to the equatorial plane\" (M\u00fcller, 1995)\n \n**Effect on Angular Velocity:**\n\nAs a result of Kepler's law, planets moving in an ellipitc orbit will have variable angular velocity \nas a result of the second law where the area swept during a constant period of time is constant (=dA/dt)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203687968-4055d194-afe0-49e8-8b73-94f1b58a3969.png\" />\n</p>\n\n\"1.) parameter: the eccentricity. If e = 0 a regular variation results that is caused by\nthe inclination of the ecliptic plane. The deviations of the apparent solar time from the\nmean solar time increase with growing e in winter and autumn. Thus, the yearly variation\nbecomes dominant. Since at the perihelion and aphelion the equation of time is only a\nfunction of the ecliptic inclination and the angle P, all plots have the same value at these\ntwo points.\n2.) parameter: the inclination of the ecliptic. \u03b5 = 0 yields a plot which is symmetric to\nthe passage through the aphelion. The greater \u03b5 the more dominant the variation with a\nperiod of half a year. All plots have four common points at the beginning of each season,\nfor the equation of time depends only on the two other parameters there (eccentricity\nand P). As the projection from the ecliptic plane onto the equatorial plane does not\nchange the polar angle relative to the winter solstice, \u03b5 does not influence the value of the\nequation of time at the beginning of a season.\n3.) parameter: the time interval between the beginning of winter and the passage\nthrough the perihelion. If \u2206t = 0 the two main variations vanish both at the beginning\nof winter and summer (because winter begins when the earth passes the perihelion; the\naphelion is the summer solstice). Therefore, the resulting function is symmetric and the\nextreme values are in autumn and winter. If \u2206t increases, the two components tend to\ncompensate each other in winter whereas the negative value in summer begins to dominate.\" (M\u00fcller, 1995)\n\nEquation of Time is the combination of the effect of eccentricity and obliquity\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22159116/203484851-c96be35a-2d4a-44df-a2ee-a9d88974aa9e.png\" />\n</p>\n\n## Documentation\n## Dependencies\n## Install\nPyPi pip install at [pypi.org/project/muller-eot/](https://pypi.org/project/muller-eot/)\n\n```\npip install muller-eot\n```\n## Examples\n## Tests\n## TODO:\n\ncalculateDistanceBetweenSolisticePerhelion() function\n\ncalculatePerihelionDay() function\n\ncalculateEccentricity() function\n",
