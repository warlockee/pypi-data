For this purpose, the **extract-data** command is used with the subcommands expression-data and gold-standard, to which the database and the output folder are specified:\n\n```sh\n# Expression data\ngeneci extract-data expression-data --database DREAM4\n\n# Gold standard\ngeneci extract-data gold-standard --database DREAM4\n```\n\n2. **Inference and consensus** of networks for the selected expression data. To perform this task, you can make use of the **run** command or proceed to an equivalent execution consisting of the **infer-network** and **optimize-ensemble** commands. This can be very useful when you need to incorporate external trust lists or run the evolutionary algorithm with different configurations on the same files, without the need to infer them several times.\n\n- **Form 1**: Procedure prefixed by the command run\n\n```sh\ngeneci run --expression-data input_data/DREAM4/EXP/dream4_010_01_exp.csv \\\n           --technique aracne --technique bc3net --technique c3net \\\n           --technique clr --technique genie3_rf --technique genie3_gbm \\\n           --technique genie3_et --technique mrnet --technique mrnetb \\\n           --technique pcit --technique tigress --technique kboost\n```\n\n- **Form 2**: Division of the procedure into several commands\n\n```sh\n# 1. Inference using individual techniques\ngeneci infer-network --expression-data input_data/DREAM4/EXP/dream4_010_01_exp.csv \\\n                     --technique aracne --technique bc3net --technique c3net --technique clr --technique mrnet \\\n                     --technique mrnetb --technique genie3_rf --technique genie3_gbm --technique genie3_et \\\n                     --technique pcit --technique tigress --technique kboost\n\n# 2. Optimize the assembly of the trust lists resulting from the above command\ngeneci optimize-ensemble --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_ARACNE.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_BC3NET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_C3NET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_CLR.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_RF.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_GBM.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_ET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNETB.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_PCIT.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_TIGRESS.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_KBOOST.csv \\\n                         --gene-names inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/gene_names.txt\n```\n\n3. **Representation** of inferred networks using the **draw-network** command:\n\n```sh\ngeneci draw-network --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/ea_consensus/final_list.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_ARACNE.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_BC3NET.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_C3NET.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_CLR.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_RF.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_GBM.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_ET.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNET.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNETB.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_PCIT.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_TIGRESS.csv \\\n                    --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_KBOOST.csv\n```\n\n4. **Evaluation** of the quality of the inferred gene network with respect to the gold standard. To do this, the evaluation data is previously downloaded with the **extract-data** command and the **evaluation-data** subcommand, which is provided with the database and the credentials of an account on the Synapse platform. After that, the **evaluate** command is executed with the subcommand **dream-prediction** to which the challenge identifier, the network identifier and the path to the evaluation files are given:\n\n```sh\n# 1. Download evaluation data\ngeneci extract-data evaluation-data --database DREAM4 --username TFM-SynapseAccount --password TFM-SynapsePassword\n\n# 2. Evaluate the accuracy of the inferred consensus network.\ngeneci evaluate dream-prediction --challenge D4C2 --network-id 10_1 \\\n                                 --synapse-file input_data/DREAM4/EVAL/pdf_size10_1.mat \\\n                                 --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/ea_consensus/final_list.csv\n```\n\n5. **Binarization** of the inferred gene network. In many cases, it is useful to apply a cutoff criterion to convert a list of confidence values into a real network that asserts the specific interaction between genes. For this purpose, the **apply-cut** command is used, which is provided with the list of confidence values, the cutoff criterion and its corresponding threshold value.\n\n```sh\ngeneci apply-cut --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/ea_consensus/final_list.csv \\\n                 --cut-off-criteria MinConfidence --cut-off-value 0.2\n```\n\n# CLI\n\n**Usage**:\n\n```console\n$ [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n```\n\n**Options**:\n\n* `--install-completion`: Install completion for the current shell.\n* `--show-completion`: Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation.\n* `--help`: Show this message and exit.\n\n**Commands**:\n\n* `apply-cut`: Converts a list of confidence values into a binary matrix that represents the final gene network.\n* `draw-network`: Draw gene regulatory networks from confidence lists.\n* `evaluate`: Evaluate the accuracy of the inferred network with respect to its gold standard.\n* `extract-data`: Extract data from different simulators and known challenges.
