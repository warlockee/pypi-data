Let's see those two options in detail.\r\n\r\n## Command Line Tool\r\n\r\nThe command line tool can be used to delete branches from a local repository that are not present in the remote repository.\r\nThe command line tool can be used as follows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrepo_cleaner --repo <path to git repository>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n--repo is the optional flag to the command. If this flag is not provided, the current working directory is assumed to be the git repository. \r\nThe tool will show the branches that are on local and remote. As shown below:\r\n```\r\n=================================================\r\nList of remote branches:\r\nmain\r\ndevelop\r\nfeature/branch1\r\n=================================================\r\nList of local branches:\r\nmain\r\ndevelop\r\nfeature/branch1\r\nfeature/branch2\r\n=================================================\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nThe tool will ask the user if they want to delete the branches that are not present in the remote repository. \r\nIf the user enters anything else other than Y or y, the tool will end its execution. Else it will display the branches that are not present in the remote repository one after the other which are\r\ngoing to be deleted and ask for confirmation before deleting each of the branches.\r\n\r\n## Library\r\n\r\nTo use this tool as a library, you can import the GitRepoCleaner class from the git_repo_cleaner module and use it as follows:\r\n\r\nfrom cleaner import git_repo_cleaner\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cleaner import git_repo_cleaner\r\n\r\ngit_repo_cleaner.main('D:\\STUDY MATERIAL\\Masters Study Material\\WS2022\\Thesis\\CodeBase\\AccessPointSearch')\r\n ```\r\nFor finer functionality, you can use the GitRepoCleaner class directly as follows:\r\n```python\r\nfrom cleaner.git_repo_cleaner import *\r\n\r\nlocal_branches, remote_branches = GitRepoCleaner.get_local_and_remote_branches()\r\nprint(local_branches)\r\n```\r\n",
