The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.  5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

CUQIpy provides a simple high-level interface to perform UQ analysis of inverse problems, while still allowing full control of the models and methods. The package comes equipped with a number of predefined distributions, samplers, models and test problems and is built to be easily further extended when needed.\n\nYou can find the full CUQIpy documentation [here](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/). \n\nThis software package is part of the [CUQI project](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/cuqi) funded by [the Villum Foundation.](https://veluxfoundations.dk/en/forskning/teknisk-og-naturvidenskabelig-forskning)\n\n## Quickstart\nInstall CUQIpy using pip:\n```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}\npip install cuqipy\n```\nFor more detailed instructions, see the [Getting Started](https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/user/getting_started.html) guide.\n\n## Quick Example - UQ in 5 steps\nImage deconvolution with uncertainty quantification\n```python\n# Imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom cuqi.testproblem import Deconvolution2D\nfrom cuqi.data import grains\nfrom cuqi.distribution import Laplace_diff, Gaussian\nfrom cuqi.problem import BayesianProblem\n\n# Step 1: Model and data, y = Ax\nA, y_data, info = Deconvolution2D.get_components(dim=128, phantom=grains())\n\n# Step 2: Prior, x ~ Laplace_diff(0, 0.01)\nx = Laplace_diff(location=np.zeros(A.domain_dim),\n                 scale=0.01,\n                 bc_type='neumann',\n                 physical_dim=2)\n\n# Step 3: Likelihood, y ~ N(Ax, 0.0036^2)\ny = Gaussian(mean=A@x, cov=0.0036**2)\n\n# Step 4: Set up Bayesian problem and sample posterior\nBP = BayesianProblem(y, x).set_data(y=y_data)\nsamples = BP.sample_posterior(200)\n\n# Step 5: Analysis\ninfo.exactSolution.plot(); plt.title(\"Exact solution\")\ny_data.plot(); plt.title(\"Data\")\nsamples.plot_mean(); plt.title(\"Posterior mean\")\nsamples.plot_std(); plt.title(\"Posterior standard deviation\")\n```\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_exact_sol.png\" alt=\"Exact solution\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_data.png\" alt=\"Data\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_post_mean.png\" alt=\"Posterior mean\" width=\"330\">\n<img src=\"https://cuqi-dtu.github.io/CUQIpy/_images/deconv2D_post_std.png\" alt=\"Posterior standard deviation\" width=\"330\">\n</p>\n\n## Plugins\nCUQIpy can be extended with additional functionality by installing optional plugins. These can be found at\n[CUQI-DTU](https://github.com/CUQI-DTU?q=CUQIpy-).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to CUQIpy.
