CyRK can accept differential equation functions \nthat are written in pure Python or njited numba, speeding up development time. The purpose of this package is to provide some \nfunctionality of [scipy's solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) with improved performance.\n\nCyRK's [numba](https://numba.discourse.group/) (njit-safe) implementation is 8-20x faster than scipy's solve_ivp function (except for very long integrations). \nThe [cython](https://cython.org/) implementation is 5-20x faster. The cython function is also largely pre-compiled which avoids most of the \ninitial performance hit found with using the numba version.\n\n<img style=\"text-align: center\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/main/Benchmarks/CyRK_SciPy_Compare_v0-2-0-dev1.png\" alt=\"CyRK Performance\" />\n\n## Installation\n\nIt is recommended you use an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) environment. CyRK has been tested on Python 3.8--3.10\n\nTo install simply open a terminal (in administrator mode if using Windows) and call:\n\n`pip install CyRK`\n\nIf not installing from a wheel, CyRK will attempt to install Cython and Numpy in order to compile the cython code. \nAfter the files have been compiled, cython will be uninstalled and CyRK's runtime dependencies \n(see the pyproject.toml file for the latest list) will be installed instead.\n\nCyRK requires the `cython` and `numpy` packages during installation. The `numpy`, `numba`, and `scipy` packages are required for runtime.\n\nA new installation of CyRK can be tested quickly by running the following from a python console.\n```python\nfrom CyRK import test_cyrk, test_nbrk\ntest_cyrk()\n# You will hopefully see the message \"CyRK's cyrk_ode was tested successfully.\"\ntest_nbrk()\n# You will hopefully see the message \"CyRK's nbrk_ode was tested successfully.\"\n```\n\n### Installation Troubleshooting\n\n*Please [report](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues) installation issues. We will work on a fix and/or add workaround information here.* \n\n> Due to [issue 9](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/9), it is reccomended that you use the flag `--no-binary`, e.g.,\n> `pip install CyRK --no-binary=\"CyRK\"`,\n> to ensure that CyRK's cython code is compiled correctly (rather than pulled from a potentially broken cache).\n\n### Development and Testing Dependencies\n\nIf you intend to work on CyRK's code base you will want to install the following dependencies in order to run CyRK's\ntest suite.\n\n`conda install pytest scipy matplotlib jupyter`\n\n`conda install` can be replaced with `pip install` if you prefer.\n\n## Using CyRK\nCyRK's API is similar to SciPy's solve_ivp function. A differential equation can be defined in python such as:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numba import njit\n# For even more speed up you can use numba's njit to compile the diffeq\n@njit\ndef diffeq_nb(t, y):\n    dy = np.empty_like(y)\n    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]\n    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]\n    return dy\n\ninitial_conds = np.asarray((20., 20.), dtype=np.complex128)\ntime_span = (0., 50.)\nrtol = 1.0e-7\natol = 1.0e-8\n```\n\nThe ODE can then be solved using the numba function by calling CyRK's `nbrk_ode`:\n\n```python\nfrom CyRK import nbrk_ode\ntime_domain, y_results, success, message = \\\n    nbrk_ode(diffeq_nb, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)\n```\n\nTo call the cython version of the integrator you need to slightly edit the differential equation so that it does not\nreturn the derivative. Instead, the output is passed as an input argument (a np.ndarray) to the function. \n\n```python\n@njit\ndef diffeq_cy(t, y, dy):\n    dy[0] = (1. - 0.01 * y[1]) * y[0]\n    dy[1] = (0.02 * y[0] - 1.) * y[1]\n```\n\nYou can then call the ODE solver in a similar fashion as the numba version.\n\n```python\nfrom CyRK import cyrk_ode\ntime_domain, y_results, success, message = \\\n    cyrk_ode(diffeq_cy, time_span, initial_conds, rk_method=1, rtol=rtol, atol=atol)\n```\n\n### Optional Inputs\n\nBoth the numba and cython versions of the ODE solver have the following optional inputs:\n- `rtol`: Relative Tolerance (default is 1.0e-6).\n- `atol`: Absolute Tolerance (default is 1.0e-8).\n- `max_step`: Maximum step size (default is +infinity).\n- `first_step`: Initial step size (default is 0).\n  - If 0, then the solver will try to determine an ideal value.\n- `args`: Python tuple of additional arguments passed to the `diffeq`.\n- `t_eval`: Both solvers uses an adaptive time stepping protocol based on the recent error at each step. This results in\na final non-uniform time domain of variable size. If the user would like the results at specific time steps then \nthey can provide a np.ndarray array at the desired steps to `t_eval`.\nThe solver will then interpolate the results to fit this array.\n- `rk_method`: Runge-Kutta method (default is 1; all of these methods are based off of\n[SciPy implementations](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)):\n  - `0` - \"RK23\" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 3(2).\n  - `1` - \"RK45\" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4).\n  - `2` - \"DOP853\" Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8.\n\n### Limitations and Known Issues\n\n- [Issue 1](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/1): Absolute tolerance can only be passed as a single value\n(same for all y's).\n- [Issue 3](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/3): Right now the cython version only allows for complex-valued\ny-values.\n- [Issue 5](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/5): The numba solver is worse than the pure python scipy solver at\nlarge timespans (high integration times).\n\n## Citing CyRK\n\nIt is great to see CyRK used in other software or in scientific studies. We ask that you cite back to CyRK's \n[GitHub](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK) website so interested parties can learn about this package. \n\nRenaud, Joe P. (2022).

You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.  3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.  ### Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.  ### Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__  b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.  ### Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.  ### Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  ### Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation.  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.  > Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
