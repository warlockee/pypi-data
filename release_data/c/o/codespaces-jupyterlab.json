Backend code is in python and uses the tornado package and is in the codespaces_jupyterlab directory.\n\n**Add any dependencies to [the dependencies array](https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyterlab/blob/eaa04c6e049e56dc41f308a8a3e9abc984dd7f62/pyproject.toml#L25) in pyproject.toml**\n\n## Requirements\n\n- JupyterLab >= 3.0\n\n## Install\n\nTo install the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip install codespaces_jupyterlab\n```\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo remove the extension, execute:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall codespaces_jupyterlab\n```\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf you are seeing the frontend extension, but it is not working, check\nthat the server extension is enabled:\n\n```bash\njupyter server extension list\n```\n\nIf the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing\nthe frontend extension, check the frontend extension is installed:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension list\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development install\n\nOpen this repository in a codespace in JupyterLab, then follow the instructions below.\n\n(The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of\n[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.)\n\n```bash\n# Change directory to the root directory\n# Install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode\njupyter server extension enable codespaces_jupyterlab\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n```\nAfter running the above commands, reload the codespace in JupyterLab and check that the new sidebar menu and extension appears.\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nBy default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=False\n```\n\n### Development uninstall\n\n```bash\n# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode\njupyter server extension disable codespaces_jupyterlab\npip uninstall codespaces_jupyterlab\n```\n\nIn development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`\ncommand. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`\nfolder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `codespaces-jupyterlab` within that folder.\n\n### Testing the extension\n\n#### Server tests\n\nThis extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.\n\nInstall test dependencies (needed only once):\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n```\n\nTo execute them, run:\n\n```sh\npytest -vv -r ap --cov codespaces_jupyterlab\n```\n\n#### Frontend tests\n\nThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.\n\nTo execute them, execute:\n\n```sh\njlpm\njlpm test\n```\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nThis extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).\nMore precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.\n\nMore information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.\n\n### Packaging the extension\n\nSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)\n\n## Current Functionality\n- [x] sidebar menu that displays basic info on the codespace\n  - [ ] Align icons with their label in sidebar menu. (icons are slightly higher)\n  - [ ] Make UI dark theme friendly\n- [ ] Activity Signals \n  - [x] Jupyter notebook cells that are executed are outputted to the console. Currently this is the only activity I'm able to record. I couldn't find any way to record other activity in the editor. Logic is here: https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyterlab/blob/main/src/index.ts#L34\n",
