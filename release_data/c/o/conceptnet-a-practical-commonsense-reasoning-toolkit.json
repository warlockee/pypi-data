            "description": "ConceptNet is a freely available commonsense knowledgebase and\r\nnatural-language-processing toolkit which supports many practical\r\ntextual-reasoning tasks over real-world documents right out-of-the-box (without\r\nadditional statistical training) including\r\n\r\n    * topic-jisting (e.g. a news article containing the concepts, \u0093gun,\u0094\r\n\u0093convenience store,\u0094 \u0093demand money\u0094 and \u0093make getaway\u0094 might suggest the topics\r\n\u0093robbery\u0094 and \u0093crime\u0094),\r\n    * affect-sensing (e.g. this email is sad and angry),\r\n    * analogy-making (e.g. \u0093scissors,\u0094 \u0093razor,\u0094 \u0093nail clipper,\u0094 and \u0093sword\u0094 are\r\nperhaps like a \u0093knife\u0094 because they are all \u0093sharp,\u0094 and can be used to \u0093cut\r\nsomething\u0094),\r\n    * text summarization\r\n    * contextual expansion\r\n    * causal projection\r\n    * cold document classification\r\n    * and other context-oriented inferences\r\n\r\nThe ConceptNet knowledgebase is a semantic network presently available in two\r\nversions: concise (200,000 assertions) and full (1.6 million assertions).\r\nCommonsense knowledge in ConceptNet encompasses the spatial, physical, social,\r\ntemporal, and psychological aspects of everyday life. Whereas similar\r\nlarge-scale semantic knowledgebases like Cyc and WordNet are carefully\r\nhandcrafted, ConceptNet is generated automatically from the 700,000 sentences of\r\nthe Open Mind Common Sense Project \u0096 a World Wide Web based collaboration with\r\nover 14,000 authors.\r\n\r\nConceptNet is a unique resource in that it captures a wide range of commonsense\r\nconcepts and relations, such as those found in the Cyc knowledgebase, yet this\r\nknowledge is structured not as a complex and intricate logical framework, but\r\nrather as a simple, easy-to-use semantic network, like WordNet. While ConceptNet\r\nstill supports many of the same applications as WordNet, such as query expansion\r\nand determining semantic similarity, its focus on concepts-rather-than-words,\r\nits more diverse relational ontology, and its emphasis on informal\r\nconceptual-connectedness over formal linguistic-rigor allow it to go beyond\r\nWordNet to make practical, context-oriented, commonsense inferences over\r\nreal-world texts.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, we want ConceptNet to be simply useful to AI Researchers\r\nand computer enthusiasts who want to experiment with adding commonsense to make\r\ntheir smart robots and programs smarter. And it's working! ConceptNet is\r\ncurrently driving tens of new innovative research projects at MIT and elsewhere!",
