            "description": "# Cracker\n\nUsable GUI for text-to-speech services (mainly AWS Polly and ESpeak).\n\n## Why all of this\n\n### What can you do with it?\n\nI (the author) have difficulty to focus on only reading.\nThe best way to read is to walk and have white noise in the background but that isn't always possible.\nThe other best way is to read both with eyes and ears.\nWhen someone reads and I can follow, I don't overly focus on how some words look weird\nor continue the line even though there is no text remaining.\nWhen someone reads what I see, it sets the pace and helps me remember/reference more easily.\n\n### Is it only reader?\n\nText often have footnotes, emoji, and other decorators.\nThese can be visually pleasing but machine needs simple text.\nCracker also provide text (de)formatters so to simplify text for Speakers.\nExamples of deformatters include removal of extensive whitespace, cryptic citation references and wikipedia decorators.\n\n### Is this an active project?\n\nKind of. I update it as I need it. It hasn't been touched in a while because of plenty of problems\nwith (Py)Qt on Linux and increased popularity of Electron (see [Pollytron](https://github.com/laszukdawid/pollytron)).\nBut, things have changed, and Qt is even better (and Electron is meh).\nI'm going to update *Cracker* as needed. Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute or submit features request.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt should be enough to checkout this package and install it's dependencies with `pip`\n\n    \n```shell\n$ git clone git@github.com:laszukdawid/cracker.git\n$ cd cracker\n$ pip install -e .\n```\n\nNow you can launch Cracker. See [Usage](#usage) section below.\n\n### Old instructions but might be necessary\n\n*PyQt5* is used to display GUI. To install PyQt5 head off to their [installation page](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html).\nPackage is currently heavily favouring Ubuntu as end OS. If you are one of the lucky ones then the installation requires:\n\n```shell\n$ sudo sh install.sh\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFor other OS you'd need *PyQt5* and *vlc*. \n\nIf you're on Ubuntu you'll most likely need additional `gstreamer` packages. Otherwise you'll see something like `defaultServiceProvider::requestService(): no service found for - \"org.qt-project.qt.mediaplayer\"`.\n\n## Usage\n\nSince this is a GUI on top of [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) it is assumed that one has credentials stored in default directory. This is `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems.\n\nCurrently reading out is performed by downloading mp3 format of the request and then using `mpg123` to play it. This isn't optimal and should be changed, but, for now, it works.\n\nSuggested execution command\n\n```bash\n$ cd cracker\n$ python -m cracker.main\n```\n\n## Key shortcuts\n\nThere's only one global command (read from clipboard).\nAll commands are expected to be called when Cracker is in focus.\n\n| Action               | Shortcut            | Global |\n|----------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| Read (clipboard)     | Ctr + Shift + Space | Yes    |\n| Read (text area)     | Ctr + Shift + R     | No     |\n| Pause / Resume read  | Ctr + Space         | No     |\n| Stop reading         | Ctr + Shift + S     | No     |\n| Reduce (all active)  | Ctr + R             | No     |\n| Reduce (wiki)        | Ctr + Shift + W     | No     |\n| Reduce (citation)    | Ctr + Shift + C     | No     |\n",
