And sometimes it's just simply necessary to, for example, ensure reproducibility, portability or to facilitate long-term maintainability of larger projects.\n\nInstead of copying this one script used for translating and writing amino acids across all projects, we can now point to AminoExtract for just that.\n\n## Installation requirements\n\nAminoExtract requires python 3.10 or later to work.  \n\nDependencies such as Pandas, Biopython and python-magic are installed during the installation procedure.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\nInstallation through conda and pip will be made available soon.\n\n1. Download the latest version of AminoExtract by cloning this repository and navigate to the newly created direcotry.  \nCopy and paste the code-snippet below in order to do so.  \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/RIVM-bioinformatics/AminoExtract.git && cd AminoExtract/\n```\n\n2. If necessary, create a conda-environment and install the necessary dependencies.  \nCopy and paste the code-snippet below in order to do so.  \n```\nmamba env create -f env.yml && conda activate AminoExtract\n```\n\n3. Now install AminoExtract into the conda environment with the following:  \n```\npip install .\n```\n\nAminoExtract is now installed!  \nYou can use AminoExtract from anywhere on your system as long as the conda-environment in which it is installed is active.  \nYou can test if installation was succesful by typing `AminoExtract -v` which should display the installed version.\n",
