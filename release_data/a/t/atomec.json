First, install `pipenv` if it is not already installed, for example via `pip install pipenv` (or see [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for    installation instructions)\n  2. Next, install `atoMEC`'s dependencies with `pipenv install`\n  3. Use `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment and install atoMEC with `pip install atoMEC` (for developers: `pip install -e .`)\n  4. Now run scripts from inside the `atoMEC` virtual environment, e.g. `python examples/simple.py`\n\n* Try running the examples in `examples/` and report any problems\n\n## Running\nYou can familiarize yourself with the usage of this package by running the example scripts in `examples/`.\n\n## Contributing to atoMEC\nWe welcome your contributions, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing to the code:\n* In general, contributors should develop on branches based off of `develop` and merge requests should be to `develop`\n* Please choose a descriptive branch name\n* Merges from `develop` to `master` will be done after prior consultation of the core development team\n* Merges from `develop` to `master` are only done for code releases. This way we always have a clean `master` that reflects the current release\n* Code should be formatted using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) style\n\n### Build documentation locally (for developers)\n\nInstall the prerequisites:\n```sh\n$ pip install -r docs/requirements.txt\n```\n\n1. Change into `docs/` folder.\n2. Run `make apidocs`.\n3. Run `make html`. This creates a `_build` folder inside `docs`. You may also want to use `make html SPHINXOPTS=\"-W\"` sometimes. This treats warnings as errors and stops the output at first occurrence of an error (useful for debugging rST syntax).\n4. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html`.\n5. `make clean` if required (e.g. after fixing errors) and building again.\n\n## Developers\n### Scientific Supervision\n- Attila Cangi ([Center for Advanced Systems Understanding](https://www.casus.science/))\n- Eli Kraisler ([Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/en))\n\n### Core Developers and Maintainers\n- Tim Callow ([Center for Advanced Systems Understanding](https://www.casus.science/))\n- Daniel Kotik ([Center for Advanced Systems Understanding](https://www.casus.science/))\n\n### Contributions (alphabetical)\n- Nathan Rahat ([Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.huji.ac.il/en))\n- Ekaterina Tsvetoslavova Stankulova ([Center for Advanced Systems Understanding](https://www.casus.science/))\n\n## Citing atoMEC\nIf you use code from this repository in a published work, please cite the DOI corresponding to the specific version of atoMEC that you used (DOIs are listed at [Zenodo.org](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5205718)).\n\nIf appropriate, you might also consider citing the following preprint in publications which use atoMEC:\n\nT.
