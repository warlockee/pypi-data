Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

            "description": "android-asset-resizer\n=====================\n\nThe Android asset resizer can be used to generate drawable assets from a larger\nsource image, like an iOS ``@2x`` asset or an ``xhdpi`` drawable.\n\nThe script will generate the expected ``mdpi``, ``hdpi``, ``xhdpi`` and\n``xxhdpi`` assets from the source image.\n\nIf you like this library and it's saved you some time, please consider\nsupporting further development with a `Gittip donation`_!\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n- `pillow`_\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install android-asset-resizer\n\nIf you'd like to use the pillow imaging library instead of PIL you can install\nthe script with this command:\n\n::\n\n    $ pip install --no-deps android-asset-resizer && pip install pillow\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nYou can easily generate Android assets from your ``@2x`` iOS assets:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize assets/icon@2x.png\n\nRunning this command will generate the following assets:\n\n::\n\n    - res\n      - drawable-mdpi\n        - icon.png\n      - drawable-hdpi\n        - icon.png\n      - drawable-xhdpi\n        - icon.png\n      - drawable-xxhdpi\n        - icon.png\n\nThese assets were created from the original ``@2x`` asset where the icon in\nthe ``drawable-xhdpi`` folder is just a copy of the original.\n\nYou can also resize an entire directory of images:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize assets/*@2x.png\n\nAn Android ``xhdpi`` asset is roughly equivalent to an ``@2x`` asset, so you\ncan easily resize those too:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize res/drawable-xhdpi/*.png\n\nIf you have a large ``drawable-xxhdpi`` asset you can use the ``--density``\nflag to generate the smaller assets:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize res/drawable-xxhdpi/*.png --density=xxhdpi\n\nYou can also easily add a prefix to your new assets:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize assets/*@2x.png --prefix=ic_\n\nUse the ``--ldpi`` flag to generate low density assets:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize res/drawable-xhdpi/*.png --ldpi\n\nUse the ``--exclude`` flag to specify a list of files that should not be\nresized:\n\n::\n\n    $ aaresize res/drawable-xhdpi/*.png --exclude=ic_launcher.png,ic_status.png\n\nYou can also import the ``AssetResizer`` class and incorporate it into your\nown scripts:\n\n::\n\n    from PIL import Image\n    from android_asset_resizer.resizer import AssetResizer\n\n    # Create our resizer\n    resizer = AssetResizer(out_dir, source_density='xhdpi',\n        prefix='ic_', image_filter=Image.ANTIALIAS)\n\n    # Make our resource directories\n    resizer.mkres()\n\n    # Resize an image\n    resizer.resize(path)\n\nBug reports\n-----------\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please open a new issue on the project's\n`GitHub page`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n::\n\n    Copyright 2013 Tristan Waddington\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n\n.. _Gittip donation: https://www.gittip.com/twaddington/\n.. _LICENSE: https://github.com/twaddington/android-asset-resizer/blob/master/LICENSE \n.. _GitHub page: https://github.com/twaddington/android-asset-resizer\n.. _pillow: https://pillow.readthedocs.io\n\n\n",
