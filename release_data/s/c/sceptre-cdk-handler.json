Of course, that\n\"artifact\" is ultimately a CloudFormation template. **CDK's specialty, thus, is really in _programmatic_\ntemplate generation with sane defaults and constructs that simplify infrastructure configuration.** It\nhides a lot of the \"magic\" behind the scenes so developers can simply prescribe what they want. CDK\nalso has deployment mechanisms to deploy that infrastructure, but they aren't really CDK's strength.\n\n90% of everything CDK does is at \"compile-time\", when the templates are being rendered. It has a very\nlimited ability to execute custom code at deployment time, and never really _between_ the deployments\nof custom stacks and resources. Furthermore, its way of wiring together stacks uses CloudFormation\nexported outputs and imports, which are rather rigid and can have a host of unintended consequences,\nespecially when values might change.\n\nIn contrast, Sceptre is a _deployment orchestration_ tool. It excels in deploying entire environments\nof stacks, \"wiring them together\" using powerful (and easily customizable) resolvers, hooks, and\ntemplate handlers. **Sceptre is \"template agnostic\"**, supporting YAML and JSON CloudFormation\ntemplates, even augmented with Jinja2 execution logic. Furthermore, out-of-the-box, Sceptre supports\n_any custom Python code to generate templates_, with the only requirement being that it needs to return\na string.\n\n_So why use CDK and Sceptre together?_ Because CDK provides excellent template generation capabilities\nand Sceptre will gladly use those. Furthermore, Sceptre has the ability to easily wire together an\nentire environment _regardless of how that environment's CloudFormation templates are generated._ Thus,\nSceptre will happily (and fairly intuitively) deploy (and \"wire together\") stacks developed in vanilla\nCloudFormation YAML/JSON, templates augmented with Jinja2, Troposphere-generated templates,\nAWS SAM templates, and CDK constructs. They can be deployed as a coherent environment that\ninteroperates, deployed with insight into the various dependencies between stacks. Furthermore,\nusing Sceptre's powerful hooks, you can execute customized pre-deployment and post-deployment code\nto prepare the way for or clean up after a given stack deployment. This is powerful and not something\nCDK provides a means to accomplish.\n\n## How to install sceptre-cdk-handler\n\n1) Install the Sceptre CDK handler using `pip install sceptre-cdk-handler`\n2) Install the AWS CDK following the instructions in [AWS CDK Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)\n3) Install the [CDK-Assets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cdk-assets) NPM package using `npm install cdk-assets`\n\nIf your project will require building and pushing docker image assets to ECR, you will also need to\ninstall docker and make it accessible on your PATH.\n\n## How to use sceptre-cdk-handler\n\nThe template \"type\" for this handler is `cdk`.\n\n### Deployment Types\nThe CDK Handler supports two different deployment types, which function somewhat differently. These\nare \"bootstrapped\" and \"bootstrapless\", both passed to the `deployment_type` template handler argument.\n\n#### The \"bootstrapped\" deployment_type\nThe \"bootstrapped\" deployment type is a more typical CDK-like way to deploy infrastructure and\nconforms more to the standard ways _CDK_ operates. If your organization has a lot of CDK infrastructure,\nusing this deployment_type likely will allow Sceptre to interoperate with existing patterns and\npolicies.\n\nThe `\"bootstrapped\"` deployment_type causes Sceptre assets (namely S3-destined files and\nECR-destined images) to be deployed using the usual CDK-bootstrapped machinery. Specifically, by\nreferencing a \"qualifier\", CDK looks for a corresponding stack in the AWS account that contains the\nspecific S3 bucket and ECR repo, as well as IAM roles to be assumed in order to build and push those\nassets up to the cloud.\n\nIn order to use the \"bootstrapped\" deployment type to push assets to the cloud, a CDK bootstrap stack\nwith matching qualifier must already be deployed. It may be deployed via CDK (outside of Sceptre) or\nyou can use CDK to generate the bootstrap template for Sceptre to deploy using\n`cdk bootstrap --show-template > cdk-bootstrap.yaml`. It is recommended, if not reusing an existing\nbootstrap stack, to deploy the bootstrap stack using Sceptre, as it will allow you to add outputs to\nthe template and reference those when setting up your CDK-based StackConfigs.\n\nWith that said, a bootstrap stack is not actually necessary if your stack includes no S3 or ECR\nassets to push.\n\n**Important:** See section below on IAM implications and behavior of using this handler and how it\ncorresponds to the roles in the bootstrap stack.\n\n#### The \"bootstrapless\" deployment_type\nWhile the \"bootstrapped\" deployment_type is more similar to CDK's way of operating, it's less typical\nfor Sceptre. Sceptre shines by allowing you to define your infrastructure however you want (in however\nmany stacks you want) and then \"wire them together\" using powerful (and very handy) hooks and\nresolvers (like `!stack_output`). Thus, a more \"Sceptre-like\" way would be to avoid using the CDK\nbootstrap stack and just providing references to the required asset-related infrastructure with\nresolvers like `!stack_output`.\n\nThe \"bootstrapless\" deployment_type uses the [cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer](https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer)\nto handle assets without needing a bootstrap stack. Instead, you can provide the relevant asset-related\nconfigurations as needed, pulling values from other stack outputs using resolvers.\n\nIf you don't need to utilize a pre-existing bootstrap stack or don't need or want the overhead of\nhaving a bootstrap stack with all the infrastructure resources created along with that (many of which\nyou might not actually need), the \"bootstrapless\" deployment_type is a simpler approach. However,\nit will require you to supply the needed bucket, ECR repository, and other configurations if you're\ndeploying file or image assets. These will need to be supplied on the `bootstrapless_config` argument.\n\n**Why wouldn't you want to use the CDK Boostrap stack if it provides \"everything you'd need\"?**\nA CDK bootstrap stack has a lot of resources, defined all together in a single stack. It's\nauto-generated via CDK. As such, it has a lot of resources you probably might not actually need,\ndepending on the sort of resources you have in your stack. For example, if you aren't actually\nbuilding and pushing images to ECR, creating a new ECR repository (which is in every CDK bootstrap\nstack) isn't necessary.\n\nAlso, every CDK bootstrap stack contains 4 different IAM roles used for four different actions\n(cloudformation service role, execution role, file asset pushing, image asset pushing). While it is\npossible to make Sceptre use all four of these roles for all four of these actions, it's not the\nnormal way Sceptre operates (where it uses the same role/profile for the all deployment actions).\nFor more information on this handler and IAM, see [the section on IAM](#IAM-and-authentication).\n\nIf there is an existing bootstrap stack you need Sceptre to integrate\nwith, using `deployment_type: \"bootstrapped\"` will adhere to those norms. But if you don't need to\nintegrate with an existing CDK ecosystem and the rest of your infrastructure is deployed with\nSceptre as well, using `deployment_type: \"bootstrapless\"`  will prove a simpler, more straight-forward\nway to deploy and integrate your CDK-stacks into the rest of your environment.\n\n### Making your stack class\nIn order to properly support this handler's functionality, your Stack class on your Python file\nshould subclass [`sceptre_cdk_handler.SceptreCdkStack`](sceptre_cdk_handler/cdk_builder.py).\nFurthermore, it should have this `__init__` signature and invoke the base class `__init__()` this\nway:\n\n```python\nimport aws_cdk\nfrom sceptre_cdk_handler import SceptreCdkStack\n\n# Subclass SceptreCDKStack\nclass CdkStack(SceptreCdkStack):\n  def __init__(self, scope: aws_cdk.App, id: str, sceptre_user_data: dict, **kwargs):\n    # Be sure you invoke super().__init__() and pass the **kwargs along to it\n    super().__init__(scope, id, sceptre_user_data, **kwargs)\n    # and then you can add your resources...\n```\n\n### Creating your StackConfig\nHere is a simple example of how to configure the template handler. For a more complete Sceptre\nProject configuration, with examples of both `bootstrapped` and `bootstrapless` configurations,\nsee [the example directory in this repo](sceptre-example/).\n\n```yaml\ntemplate:\n    # To use the CDK handler, you should use the \"cdk\" template type\n    type: cdk\n    # The path is always within your project's templates/ directory.\n    path: lambda_stack.py\n    deployment_type: bootstrapless\n    # bootstrapless_config are the snake_cased arguments passed to the cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer\n    # for definitions of possible parameters, see the API docs here:\n    # https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer/blob/main/API.md\n    bootstrapless_config:\n        # You can use !stack_attr to reference other stack attributes that happen\n        # to be set with resolvers to chain the resolver value. It makes sense to use the\n        # same bucket as Sceptre uses for its template uploads for your file assets.\n        file_asset_bucket_name: !stack_attr template_bucket_name\n        # It can be useful to apply the same prefix as your template_key_prefix to ensure your\n        # assets are namespaced similarly to the rest of Sceptre's uploaded artifacts.\n        file_asset_prefix: {{template_key_prefix}}/cdk-assets\n        # You can use !stack_output (and other resolvers) in all of these configurations, which is\n        # especially helpful when \"wiring together\" this stack with other stacks deployed in your\n        # environment.\n        image_asset_repository_name: !stack_output ecr.yaml::RepoName\n    # You can explicitly define your stack name, or use the default class name \"CdkStack\"\n    class_name: MyLambdaStack\n\n# Parameters are DEPLOY-TIME values passed to the CloudFormation template. Your CDK stack construct\n# needs to have CfnParameters in order to support this, though.\nparameters:\n    SpecialEnv: \"This is my Sceptre test\"\n\n# sceptre_user_data is passed to your Stack Class's constructor for supplying values at COMPILE-TIME.\nsceptre_user_data:\n    special_variable: \"use this directly at compile_time\"\n```\n\n### Arguments:\n\n* `path` (string, required): The path to the CDK template file, relative to the `templates/` directory of\n  your project. This should be a python file with your stack class, subclassing `SceptreCdkStack`.\n* `deployment_type` (string, required): This determines the way CDK assets should be pushed to the\n  cloud. Options are `\"bootstrapless\"` and `\"bootstrapped\"`. See section above on \"How to use\" for\n  more details.\n* `bootstrap_qualifier` (string, optional): This is only used if you are using the `bootstrapped`\n  deployment type. This qualifier refers to the qualifier on a given CDK bootstrap stack in your\n  AWS account, whether deployed via CDK externally or within the same Sceptre project. If you use\n  the `bootstrapped` deployment_type and do NOT specify a qualifier, CDK will default to the default\n  qualifier and look to use that in your account.\n* `class_name` (string, optional): The name of the class on your CDK template to synthesize.\n  Defaults to `CdkStack`.\n* `context` (dict, optional): The context for the CDK Stack. See [CDK Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/context.html)\nfor further info on this.\n* `bootstrapless_config` (dict, optional): This is only used if you are using the `bootstrapless`\ndeployment type. The keys here are the snake-casings of the documented parameters using the\n[cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer](https://github.com/aws-samples/cdk-bootstrapless-synthesizer/blob/main/API.md):\n    - \"file_asset_bucket_name\" (required if your stack has file assets)\n    - \"file_asset_prefix\"\n    - \"file_asset_publishing_role_arn\"\n    - \"file_asset_region_set\"\n    - \"image_asset_account_id\"\n    - \"image_asset_publishing_role_arn\"\n    - \"image_asset_region_set\"\n    - \"image_asset_repository_name\" (required if your stack has image assets)\n    - \"image_asset_tag_prefix\"\n    - \"template_bucket_name\"\n\n#### Passing Data to a CDK Stack\n\nThere are two methods for passing data to a CDK Stack; using `sceptre_user_data` or CloudFormation parameters:\n\n##### Sceptre User Data\n\nData can be passed to a CDK stack using the `sceptre_user_data` block of the Sceptre stack config.\nThis will be resolved when the template is synthesized and can contain complex objects. Since\n`sceptre_user_data` is a resolvable property, you can use Resolvers to pass values from other\ndeployed stacks and other sources as well.\n\n##### CloudFormation Parameters\n\nData can be passed to a synthesized CDK template using standard CloudFormation parameters.\nThese are resolved when the CloudFormation stack is created from the template, but can only contain\nstring or list values as supported by Cloudformation. In order to use these, you need to create\n[`CfnParameter`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.CfnParameter.html) resources\nin your stack class.\n\n#### Stack Outputs\n\nCloudFormation stack outputs can be defined in the CDK stack and then referenced from other Sceptre\nstacks using the standard Sceptre `!stack_output` resolver. In order to do this, your Stack Class\nwill need to create [`CfnOutput`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.CfnOutput.html)\nresources in your stack class.\n\n#### CDK Feature Flags and Custom Bootstrap\n\nTo set any [CDK Feature Flags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/featureflags.html), set these\nin the handler's `context` argument. See [lambda-stack-bootstrapped.yaml](sceptre-example/config/lambda-stack-bootstrapped.yaml)\nfor an example of this.\n\nReminder: the `context` argument is a standard Sceptre resolvable property, so resolvers and/or Jinja\nvariables can be used for values.\n\n### How does this handler work?\n\nWhen using _only_ the CDK CLI (not Sceptre) to deploy using `cdk deploy`, the CDK CLI effectively performs\nthe following steps:\n\n1. Synthesises any constructs defined within the CDK Class into a CloudFormation Template and a\nbundle of required assets.\n2. Publishes the assets to a CDK bootstrapped S3 bucket and/or ECR registry.\n3. Creates/updates a CloudFormation stack from the synthesized template.\n\nWhen you use Sceptre with this handler, the CDK handler performs steps 1-2 above to create a template\nthat Sceptre can use and publish the assets, **but it does not use CDK to deploy it!**. Instead,\nSceptre can use that template produced in step 1 above to perform all its usual commands with all\nit's usual magic!\n\nIn other words, using this handler lets you use resolvers, put your CDK stack into StackGroups, let\nyou name your stack according to Sceptre's naming conventions, `validate`, `diff`, and more! Basically,\nthe CDK stack can be managed using Sceptre just like any other.\n\n### IAM and authentication\n\nThere are several dimensions to how using this handler applies to IAM roles, policies, and permissions.\n\n#### The Role to deploy the CloudFormation Stacks themselves\nSceptre will always use the AWS environment configuration, `profile` and/or `iam_role` to deploy\nthe CloudFormation _Stacks_ themselves. This is consistent with how Sceptre always operates and it's\nno different when using this handler.\n\nIf you want Sceptre to assume the Deployment Role from the CDK bootstrap stack, you'll need to\nspecify that role as the `iam_role` for your stack(s). If you want to do this, it's recommended you\nadd the deployment role as an output on your bootstrap stack and then set `iam_role` using a\n`!stack_output` or `!stack_output_external` resolver. Be aware that your current AWS environment's\ncredentials will need permission to assume this role.\n\nFor more information on the `iam_role` configuration, see [Sceptre docs on it](https://docs.sceptre-project.org/3.2.0/docs/stack_config.html#iam-role).\n\n#### The role provided to CloudFormation as the execution role\nBy default, Sceptre doesn't provide an [execution/service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-iam-servicerole.html)\nto CloudFormation for stacks. This is a permanent action with implications you should be aware of.\nCDK _does_ tend to prefer using these, however, and one is created within the standard CDK bootstrap\nstack.\n\nIf you want Sceptre to provide a service role to the stack, you'll need to specify that role as the\nstack's `role_arn`. Thus, you can use the Bootstrapped CloudFormation execution role if you want to\nor your organization generally requires that. If you want to do this, it's recommended you add the\nexecution role as an output on your bootstrap stack and then set `role_arn` using `!stack_output` or\n`!stack_output_external`.\n\nFor more information on the `role_arn` configuration, see [Sceptre docs on it](https://docs.sceptre-project.org/3.2.0/docs/stack_config.html#role-arn).\n\n#### The roles used to push file and image assets to the Cloud\nSome sorts of CDK constructs require the packaging and upload to the cloud of S3-destined file assets\nor ECR-destined image assets. These will each be published with different IAM permissions, depending\non how you've configured your CDK handler.\n\n* If using the `\"bootstrapless\"` `deployment_type` and you have _not_ explicitly specified a\n`file_asset_publishing_role_arn` or `image_asset_publishing_role_arn`, CDK will use your configured\nSceptre deployment role (if you have an iam_role specified), your profile (if specified), or your\nAWS environment credentials to push those credentials. If this is the case, be sure your credentials\nhave permissions to perform those Put/Push operations.\n* If using the `\"bootstrapless\"` `deployment_type` and you _have_ explicitly specified a\n`file_asset_publishing_role_arn` and/or `image_asset_publishing_role_arn`, CDK will assume those\nroles (from your current deployment iam_role, profile, or AWS environment credentials) for their\nrespective actions in order to perform those Put/Push operations. If this is the case, be sure that\nyour iam_role, profile, or AWS environment credentials have permission to assume those roles.\n* If using the `\"bootstrapped\"` `deployment_type`, CDK will assume the respective roles from your\nbootstrap stack in order to perform those operations. If this is the case, be sure that\nyour iam_role, profile, or AWS environment credentials have permission to assume those roles.\n\n### Example Sceptre CDK Stack\n\n[sceptre-example](sceptre-example)\n\n\n",
