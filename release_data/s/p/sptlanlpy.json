This was the best way I could think to organize all the data with abstraction\n  *  Meaning a class instance MUST be declared to make calls to the functions\n  *  READ the COMMENTS above !!def __init__!! to understand how to declare an instance of the class\n\n # Autors Note\n This library was a passion project made for purposes of streamlining work that the Michigan Sports Consulting Group (MSCG) at the University of Michigan does for Economic Analysis Reports. By uploading this, I hope that this work for MSCG will have an impact that outlasts my time in the club. I also hope others find use of this library. \n\nBest,\nJacob Brinkmann\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-brinkmann-567438206/\n\n\n",
