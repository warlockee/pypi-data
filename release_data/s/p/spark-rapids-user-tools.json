Qualification: Educate the CPU customer on the cost savings and acceleration potential of RAPIDS Accelerator for\n   Apache Spark. The output shows a list of apps recommended for RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark with estimated savings\n   and speed-up.\n2. Bootstrap: Provide optimized RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark configs based on Dataproc GPU cluster shape. The output\n   shows updated Spark config settings on Dataproc master node.\n3. Tuning: Tune RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark configs based on initial job run leveraging Spark event logs. The output\n   shows recommended per-app RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark config settings.\n4. Diagnostics: Run diagnostic functions to validate the Dataproc with RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark environment to\n   make sure the cluster is healthy and ready for Spark jobs.\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nset python environment to version [3.8, 3.10]\n\n1.

It can be\n      nested.\n    - For keys, the wrapper accepts camelCase and underscores keywords. i.e., `cluster_config` and `clusterConfig`\n      are both accepted.\n    - For each node type (master/worker), the configuration file has to indicate the following:\n        - `machine_type_uri` or `machineTypeUri`\n        - `num_instances` or `numInstances`\n        - `image_version` or `imageVersion`\n    - Optional configurations:\n        - `num_local_ssds` or `numLocalSsds`. For GPU clusters, the value will be set to 1 when the config is missing.\n        - `accelerators` configuration is ignored since the wrapper command line overrides the GPU accelerators.\n    - example of accepted files:\n        - json file\n          ```json\n              {\n                \"cluster_config\": {\n                  \"software_config\": {\n                    \"image_version\": \"1.5\"\n                  },\n                  \"gce_cluster_config\": {\n                    \"metadata\": {\n                      \"enable-pepperdata\": \"true\"\n                    }\n                  },\n                  \"master_config\": {\n                    \"machine_type_uri\": \"n1-standard-16\",\n                    \"disk_config\": {\n                      \"boot_disk_size_gb\": 100\n                    }\n                  },\n                  \"worker_config\": {\n                    \"num_instances\": 2,\n                    \"machine_type_uri\": \"n1-standard-16\",\n                    \"disk_config\": {\n                      \"boot_disk_size_gb\": 100\n                    }\n                  },\n                  \"secondary_worker_config\": {\n                    \"num_instances\": 2,\n                    \"machine_type_uri\": \"n1-standard-16\",\n                    \"disk_config\": {\n                      \"boot_disk_size_gb\": 100\n                    }\n                  }\n                }\n              }\n          ```\n        - yaml file\n          ```yaml\n              cluster_config:\n                gce_cluster_config:\n                  metadata:\n                    enable-pepperdata: 'true'\n                master_config:\n                  disk_config:\n                    boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                  machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                secondary_worker_config:\n                  disk_config:\n                    boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                  machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                  num_instances: 2\n                software_config:\n                  image_version: '1.5'\n                worker_config:\n                  disk_config:\n                    boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                  machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                  num_instances: 2\n          ```\n        - The cluster configs are not at top level.\n          ```yaml\n            key_level0:\n              key_level1:\n                cluster_config:\n                  gce_cluster_config:\n                    metadata:\n                      enable-pepperdata: 'true'\n                  master_config:\n                    disk_config:\n                      boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                    machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                  secondary_worker_config:\n                    disk_config:\n                      boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                    machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                    num_instances: 2\n                  software_config:\n                    image_version: '1.5'\n                  worker_config:\n                    disk_config:\n                      boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n                    machine_type_uri: n1-standard-16\n                    num_instances: 2\n          ```\n        - Camel Case file is accepted:\n          ```yaml\n            clusterConfig:\n              gceClusterConfig:\n                metadata:\n                  enable-pepperdata: 'true'\n              masterConfig:\n                diskConfig:\n                  bootDiskSizeGb: 100\n                machineTypeUri: n1-standard-16\n              secondaryWorkerConfig:\n                diskConfig:\n                  bootDiskSizeGb: 100\n                machineTypeUri: n1-standard-16\n                numInstances: 2\n              softwareConfig:\n                imageVersion: '2.0'\n              workerConfig:\n                diskConfig:\n                  bootDiskSizeGb: 100\n                machineTypeUri: n1-standard-16\n                numInstances: 2\n          ```\n\n            - example `cpu_cluster_props` argument passed to CLI\n              ```\n                spark_rapids_dataproc qualification \\\n                           --cluster jobs-test-gpu-support \\\n                           --region us-central1 --cpu_cluster_props=/tmp/test_cpu_cluster_prop.yaml \\\n                           --eventlogs=gs://my-bucket/qualification_testing/dlrm_cpu/,gs://my-bucket/qualification_testing/tpcds_100in1/\n          \n                2022-11-04 17:11:02,284 INFO qualification: The CPU cluster is an offline cluster.

The files can\nbe stored locally or on GCS bucket.\n\n- Format of the cluster configuration:\n  - Both Json and Yaml formats are accepted\n  - For the top level entry of configurations, both `config` and `cluster_config` are accepted.\n  - `config` or `cluster_config` does not have to be the first entry in the yaml/json file. It can be\n    nested.\n  - For keys, the wrapper accepts camelCase and underscores keywords. i.e., `cluster_config` and `clusterConfig`\n    are both accepted.\n  - For the workers, the configuration has to indicate valid GPU accelerators.\n  - Example of accepted file:\n    ```yaml\n      default:\n        xyz_config:\n          absdt_config:\n            xyz_version: '2.0'\n            team:\n              tr_product_id: '1982'\n          cluster_config:\n            gce_cluster_config:\n              metadata:\n                enable-pepperdata: 'true'\n            master_config:\n              disk_config:\n                boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n              machine_type_uri: n1-standard-8\n            secondary_worker_config:\n              disk_config:\n                boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n              machine_type_uri: n1-standard-32\n              num_instances: 2\n            software_config:\n              image_version: '2.0'\n            worker_config:\n              disk_config:\n                boot_disk_size_gb: 100\n              machine_type_uri: n1-standard-32\n              num_instances: 2\n              accelerators:\n              - accelerator_count: 4\n                accelerator_type_uri: nvidia-tesla-t4\n    ```\n\n### Bootstrap Tool\n\nProvides optimized RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark configs based on Dataproc GPU cluster shape.\nThis tool is supposed to be used once a cluster has been created to set the recommended configurations.\n\n#### Sample commands\n\n- run the bootstrap tool help cmd `spark_rapids_dataproc bootstrap --help`\n  ```bash\n  NAME\n      spark_rapids_dataproc bootstrap - The bootstrap tool analyzes the CPU and GPU configuration of\n      the Dataproc cluster and updates the Spark default configuration on the cluster's master nodes.\n\n  SYNOPSIS\n      spark_rapids_dataproc bootstrap CLUSTER REGION <flags>\n\n  DESCRIPTION\n      The bootstrap tool analyzes the CPU and GPU configuration of the Dataproc cluster and updates the\n      default configuration on the cluster's master nodes.\n\n  POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS\n      CLUSTER\n          Type: str\n          Name of the dataproc cluster\n      REGION\n          Type: str\n          Compute region (e.g. us-central1) for the cluster.\n\n  FLAGS\n      --output_folder=OUTPUT_FOLDER\n          Type: str\n          Default: '.'\n          Base output directory.
