            "description": "# stormcatchments\n## Stormwater network aware catchment delineation\n\nConverts existing stormwater infrastucture GIS feature data (points and lines) into a\n```networkx``` directed graph (```DiGraph```) object, then utilizes the ```DiGraph``` to\nincorporate subsurface flows into urban stormwater catchment delineation.\n\nVarious dependencies include:\n- ```geopandas```\n- ```networkx```\n- ```pysheds```\n\nSimilar libraries/projects:\n- [```s2g```](https://github.com/caesar0301/s2g)\n- [```networkx``` module ```nx_shp.py```](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/6e20b952a957af820990f68d9237609198088816/networkx/readwrite/nx_shp.py)\n\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install from PyPI:\n```\npip install stormcatchments\n```\n\n## Input data requirements\n\nTo utilize this package, you need both **point** and **line** spatial data, which could represent a network of catchbasins and stormlines. The file format does not matter as long as it can be successfully read into a ```geopandas.GeoDataFrame```. The line data must connect to the points, and lines must have verticies snapped to the points.\nThis was initially developed for [Vermont Agency of Natural Resources stormwater infrastructure dataset](https://gis-vtanr.hub.arcgis.com/maps/VTANR::stormwater-infrastructure/explore?location=43.609172%2C-72.968811%2C14.15). However, the package is indented to generalize to any infrastructure dataset that meets these basic requirements.\n\n\n## Mapping ```IS_SINK``` and ```IS_SOURCE```\n\nFlow sinks are where flow can enter a subsurface system (such as a catchbasin). Flow sources are where flow can exit a subsurface system (such as an outfall). Initializing the ```network.Network``` requires either:\n- Manually setting two ```bool``` columns in the point ```GeoDataFrame```, named ```IS_SINK``` and ```IS_SOURCE``` that are set to ```True``` if a point falls into either category.\n- Defining a ```type_column``` in the point data, then supplying a ```list``` of ```sink_types``` and a ```list``` of ```source_types``` to lookup in the ```type_column```. This will then be mapped onto two ```bool``` columns in the point data named ```IS_SINK``` and ```IS_SOURCE```.\n\n\n## Determining subsurface flow direction\n\nResolving the flow direction of subsurface stormwater networks, which is doing during ```network.Network.resolve_directions()```, can be done in three ways:\n1) ```from_sources```: This is the default. This method traces networks upstream from their discharge points. This assumes that subnetworks are comprised of one or more flow sink that flow to a single flow source. If multiple flow sources are connected to a given flow sink, this method will run into issues since determining which flow source is the terminal node in the graph would need to incorporate pipe elevation data somehow.\n2) ```vertex_order```: This defines the subsurface flow direction using the order of verticies in the line data (flowing from the first to last vertex).\n3) ```vertex_order_r```: This is the same as above, but in reverse (flowing from last to first vertex).\n\nTwo other potential methods that are not yet implemented are:\n- Using surface elevation data as an analog for for subsurface pipe elevations. In flat urban settings this would likely have a lot of issues/inaccuracies.\n- Using pipe invert data from the attributes of point or line data. This would require manual preparation by the user but would be the most accurate method.\n\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Imports\n```python\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom stormcatchments import delineate, network, terrain\n```\n### Read infrastructure data\n```python\nstorm_lines = gpd.read_file('tests/test_data/johnson_vt/storm_lines.shp')\nstorm_lines.set_index('OBJECTID', inplace=True)\nstorm_pts = gpd.read_file('tests/test_data/johnson_vt/storm_pts.shp')\nstorm_pts.set_index('OBJECTID', inplace=True)\n```\n### Initialize Network object and resolve directions\n```python\n# storm_pts contains a column \"Type\" with integer values describing what type of \n# structure each point is\nsinks = [2, 8] # Corresponds to catchbasins and culvert inlets\nsources = [5, 9] # Corresponds to outfalls and culvert outlets\n\nnet = network.Network(\n  storm_lines, storm_pts, type_column='Type', sink_types=sinks, source_types=sources\n)\nnet.resolve_directions(method='from_sources')\n```\n### Preprocess terrain data\n```python\ngrid, fdir, acc = terrain.preprocess_dem('tests/test_data/johnson_vt/dem.tif')\n```\nNote that ```terrain.preprocess_dem()``` uses default settings for ```pysheds```. Feel free to experiment with this step to try and improve results with your terrain data.\n### Initialize Delineate object and get a stormcatchment\n```python\ngrid_epsg = 6589\ndelin = delineate.Delineate(net, grid, fdir, acc, grid_epsg)\n\n# (x, y) coordinates in same CRS as grid\npour_pt = (484636, 237170)\nstormcatchment = delin.get_stormcatchment(pour_pt)\n```\n### Also get the original catchment (network unaware) to compare results\n```python\ncatchment = delineate.get_catchment(pour_pt, grid, fdir, acc, 6589)\n```\n### Plot original catchment in blue and stormcatchment in orange\nThis uses the built-in ```net.draw()``` method, which adds a ```contextily``` basemap when ```add_basemap=True```. Note that the orange stormcatchment incorporates a large hillside \nthat pipes to the pour point.\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\nstormcatchment.plot(ax=ax, ec='orange', fc='orange', alpha=0.7, linewidth=3)\ncatchment.plot(ax=ax, ec='blue', fc='blue', alpha=0.7, linewidth=3)\nnet.draw(ax=ax, add_basemap=True)\n```\n![Plot of catchment and stormcatchment](img/example_stormcatchment.png)\n\n",
