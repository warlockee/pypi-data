            "description": "PyBERT\n======\n\nPyBERT is a serial communication link bit error rate tester simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nIt uses the Traits/UI package of the Enthought Python Distribution (EPD) <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>,\nas well as the NumPy and SciPy packages.\n\nNotice: Before using this package for any purpose, you MUST read and understand the terms put forward in the accompanying \"LICENSE\" file.\n\nWiki\n----\n\n- https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n- https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/pybert_faq\n\nEmail List\n----------\n\n- <pybert@freelists.org>\n\nUser Installation\n-----------------\n\n- <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/instant_gratification>\n\nDeveloper Installation\n----------------------\n\n- <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/dev_install>\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTox is used for the test runner and documentation builder.  By default, it will try to unit test\nfor any installed/supported of versions and it will skip any missing versions.\n\n- `pip install tox`\n- `tox -p all`\n\nTo run a single environment such as \"docs\" run: `tox -e docs`\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nPyBERT documentation exists in 2 separate forms:\n\n- For developers:\n\n  - pybert/doc/build/html/index.html  (See testing on how to build the documentation)\n  - https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/dev_install\n\n- For users:\n\n  - Quick installation instructions at <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/instant_gratification>\n  - The 'Help' tab of the PyBERT GUI\n  - The PyBERT FAQ at <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/pybert_faq>\n  - Sending e-mail to David Banas at <capn.freako@gmail.com>\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nI would like to thank the following individuals for their contributions to the *PyBERT* project:\n\n**David Patterson** for being my main co-author and for his countless hours\ndriving the PyBERT project across the Python2<=>Python3 divide, as well as,\nmore recently, completely updating its build infrastructure to be more in sync.\nw/ modern Python package building/testing/distribution philosophy.\n\n**Peter Pupalaikis** for sharing his expertise w/ both Fourier transform and\nS-parameter subtleties. The PyBERT source code wouldn't have nearly the\nmathematical/theoretical fidelity that it does had Peter not contributed.\n\n**Yuri Shlepnev** for his rock solid understanding of RF fundamentals, as\nwell as his infinite patience in helping me understand them, too. ;-)\n\n**Dennis Han** for thoroughly beating the snot out of PyBERT w/ nothing but\nlove in his heart and determination in his mind to drive PyBERT further towards\na professional level of quality. Dennis has made perhaps the most significant\ncontributions towards making PyBERT a serious tool for the working professional\nserial communications link designer.\n\n**Todd Westerhoff** for helping me better understand what tool features really\nmatter to working professional link designers and which are just in the way.\nAlso, for some very helpful feedback, re: improving the real World PyBERT\nexperience for the user.\n\n**Mark Marlett** for first introducing me to Python/NumPy/SciPy, as an\nalternative to MATLAB for numerical computing and signal processing, as\nwell as his countless hours of tutelage, regarding the finer points of\nserial communication link simulation technique. Mark is also the one,\nwho insisted that I take a break from development and finally write\nsome documentation, so that others could understand what I intended and,\nhopefully, contribute. Thanks, Mark!\n\n**Low Kian Seong** for straightening out my understanding of the real\npurpose of the *description* field in the *setup.py* script.\n\n**Jason Ellison** for many cathartic chats on the topic of quality open\nsource software creation, maintenance, and distribution.\n\n**Michael Gielda** & **Denz Choe** for their contributions to the PyBERT\ncode base.\n\n**The entire SciKit-RF team** for creating and supporting an absolutely\nwonderful Python package for working with RF models and simulations.\n",
