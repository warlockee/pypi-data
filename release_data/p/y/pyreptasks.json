To do so, you can download the file or just copy it into a \"develop_requirements.txt\" file then do\n\n% pip install -r develop_requirements.txt\n\nThis project uses \"black\" to format code. We support \"pre-commit\" to ensure this formatting has been run. If you have installed the requirements, you should have these packages already installed.\n\n\"Codecov\" is set up for this project, so for any push or pull request you may check the code coverage report at https://app.codecov.io/gh/tsenovilla/pyreptasks. \n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis project uses \"pytest\" to run the tests defined in the folder \"tests\". \n\nTo run the tests localy, install the test requirements described in requirement_files/tests_requirements.txt. To do so, you can download the file or just copy it into a \"tests_requirements.txt\" then do\n\n% pip install -r test_requirements.txt\n\nTo run all the tests, go to the repository where you have stored the folder \"tests\" and run:\n\n% pytest\n\nIn the case that you would like to run only a specific test, select it with pytest:\n\n% pytest tests/test_switch.py\n\nVersions log\n============\n\nVersion 1.0.0\n-------------\n\n- New module switch.py: Contains the class Switch, allowing the user to skip defining a switch structure.\n\nVersion 2.0.0\n-------------\n\n- Update of module switch.py: From this version, integer_switch is not a parameter available for the class Switch   anymore. This parameter was used in a Switch object to indicate that the switch had to contain only integer keys. The parameter is deleted due to it was not actually useful. \n\n- Switch examples and tests updates to fit with the new version.\n\n- Other changes: \n  - Adoption of the use of setuptools_scm (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) package to manage version control instead of versioneer, used in the previous version. This also allows us to get rid of some configuration and version control files, in order to get a simpler package. \n  \n  - Adoption of pyproject.toml in order to fit the standard PEP 518. \n\n  - Creation of release.yaml to automate releases when a new tag is pushed to GitHub. \n\nVersion 2.0.1\n-------------\n\n- Bug fix: The version 2.0.0 changed the folder's name containing the source code, named \"pyreptasks\", to \"src\", without creating a \"pyreptasks\" package inside. This change created a conflict when importing the package, as its name was not anymore \"pyreptasks\" but \"src\". This new version solves that oblivion by creating a Python package \"pyreptasks\" inside the \"src\" folder. \n\n- Deletion of the file setup.py as it is not needed anymore with the introduction of pyproject.toml\n\n- The former file \"requirements.txt\" might have been misunderstood, as it does not contain the actual requirements to run \"pyreptasks\", but the requirements to make correctly a git commitment. Due to up to this version there is not need of any other Python package to run \"pyreptasks\", this file is now named \"develop_requirements.txt\", and it is included in the new folder \"requirement_files\", with the file containing the packages needed for testing (\"tests_requirements.txt\"). If \"pyreptasks\" needs another Python package to run in the future, the \"requirements.txt\" file would be created again to carry out its actual rol. \n\n- As setup.py is not available anymore, the workflows have been updated accordingly.\n\nReleasing\n=========\n\nReleases are published automatically when a tag is pushed to GitHub:\n\n  export RELEASE=x.x.x\n\n  git commit --allow-empty -m \"Release $RELEASE\"\n  git tag -a $RELEASE -m \"Version $RELEASE\"\n\n  git push upstream --tags\n\nWorkflows\n=========\n\n- CI (Continuous Integration): This workflow runs the test files contained in \"tests\" using pytest. It also runs code coverage to ensure the whole code is being used.\n\n- Pre-commit: This workflow ensures that all Python files respect PEP 8 formatting, via black.\n\n- Build distribution: This workflow ensures that each time a push is made, the project pushed is in a packageable state. Furthermore, if a tag is pushed, the workflow publishes the package on PyPI.\n\n\nOther\n=====\n\nAuthor: Tom\u00e1s Senovilla Polo\n\nEmail : tspscgs@gmail.com\n\nLicense: pyreptasks is available under the MIT license. See LICENSE.txt for more information.\n\nIf you have in mind some functionality deserving to be included in \"pyreptasks\", let me know it! I will be happy to include it in a new version :smile:\n",
