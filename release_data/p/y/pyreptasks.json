To do so, you can download the file or just copy it into a develop_requirements.txt file then do\n\n% pip install -r develop_requirements.txt\n\nThis project uses `black` to format code. We support `pre-commit` to ensure this formatting has been run. If you have installed the requirements, you should have these packages already installed.\n\n`Codecov` is set up for this project, so for any push or pull request you may check the code coverage report at https://app.codecov.io/gh/tsenovilla/pyreptasks. \n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis project uses `pytest` to run the tests defined in the folder `tests`. Tests ensure that future releases will not break the former functionality unexpectedly. If some functionality is updated, the tests must be updated accordingly. If a test fails, there are two possibilities: either the tests are not up to date (no problem, it is just an oversight, just make them be coherent with the new version) or something in the code has changed but it should not have been modified. It is up to the developper to determine the actual situation.\n\nTo run the tests locally, install the test requirements described in `requirement_files/tests_requirements.txt`. To do so, you can download the file or just copy it into a tests_requirements.txt then do\n\n% pip install -r test_requirements.txt\n\nTo run all the tests, go to the repository where you have stored the folder `tests` and run:\n\n% pytest\n\nIn the case that you would like to run only a specific test, select it individually, for example:\n\n% pytest tests/test_switch.py\n\nVersions log\n============\n\nVersion 1.0.0\n-------------\n\n- New module `switch.py`: Contains the class Switch, allowing the user to skip defining a switch structure.\n\nVersion 2.0.0\n-------------\n\n- Update of module `switch.py`: From this version, integer_switch is not a parameter available for the class Switch   anymore. This parameter was used in a Switch object to indicate that the switch had to contain only integer keys. The parameter is deleted due to it was not actually useful. \n\n- Switch examples and tests updates to fit with the new version.\n\n- Other changes: \n  - Adoption of the use of `setuptools_scm` (https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) package to manage version control instead of `versioneer`, used in the previous version. This also allows us to get rid of some configuration and version control files, in order to get a simpler package. \n  \n  - Adoption of `pyproject.toml` introduced in the standard PEP 518. \n\n  - Creation of `release.yaml` to automate releases when a new tag is pushed to GitHub. \n\nVersion 2.0.1\n-------------\n\n- Bug fix: The version 2.0.0 changed the folder's name containing the source code, named `pyreptasks`, to `src`, without creating a `pyreptasks` package inside. This change created a conflict when importing the package, as its name was not anymore `pyreptasks` but `src`. This new version solves that oversight by creating a Python package `pyreptasks` inside the `src` folder. \n\n- Deletion of the file `setup.py` as it is not needed anymore with the introduction of `pyproject.toml`\n\n- The former file `requirements.txt` might have been misunderstood, as it does not contain the actual requirements to run `pyreptasks`, but the requirements to make correctly a git commitment. Due to up to this version there is not need of any other Python package to run `pyreptasks`, this file is now named `develop_requirements.txt`, and it is included in the new folder `requirement_files`, with the file containing the packages needed for testing (`tests_requirements.txt`). If `pyreptasks` needs another Python package to run in the future, the `requirements.txt` file would be created again to carry out its actual rol. \n\n- As `setup.py` is not available anymore, the workflow `release.yaml` have been updated accordingly.\n\nVersion 2.1.0\n-------------\n\n- New module `data_formatter.py`: This module introduces the class DataFormatter. An object created with this class allows to define fields that should respect certain format. There are several options to customize the format of each field. Then, the object is able to convert some data string into the format specified by the fields, as well as to ensure that the data respects the fields constraints, otherwise it will throw an exception. Everything is done in a few lines, enabling the developper to skip coding many data controls and format conversions.\n\nWorkflows\n=========\n\n- CI (Continuous Integration): This workflow runs the test files contained in `tests` using `pytest`. It also runs code coverage to ensure the whole code is being used.\n\n- Pre-commit: This workflow ensures that all Python files respect PEP 8 formatting, via `black`.\n\n- Build distribution: This workflow ensures that each time a push/pull request is made, the project is in a packageable state. Furthermore, if a tag is pushed, the workflow publishes the package on PyPI.\n\n\nOther\n=====\n\nAuthor: Tom\u00e1s Senovilla Polo\n\nEmail : tspscgs@gmail.com\n\nLicense: pyreptasks is available under the MIT license.

I will be happy to include it in future releases :smile: \n",
