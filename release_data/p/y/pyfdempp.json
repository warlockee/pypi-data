            "description": "# pyfdempp - An FDEM Visualiser Post-Processing Package\n\n## About\n\nThis Python package performs transformations on hybrid finite-discrete element method (FDEM) models with an unstructured grid in vtk/vtu/vtp format. It currently supports arrays of simulation files from the FDEM solvers:\n- [Geomechanica's Irazu software](https://www.geomechanica.com/software/),\n- [Y-Geo](https://geogroup.utoronto.ca/software/) (and its common derivatives), as well as \n- [OpenFDEM](https://openfdem.com/html/index.html).\n\nThe package is heavily dependent on `pyvista` and is limited to `Python >=3.5`. The package is maintained by the [Grasselli's Geomechanics Group](https://geogroup.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, Canada, and is part of a collaborative effort by the open-source pacakge [OpenFDEM](https://openfdem.com/html/index.html).\n\n## Functionality\n\nThis Python package performs transformations on FDEM models in vtk/vtu format. \nFunctions calculated include:\n- Extract information within the FDEM Model based on the name of the array (e.g., Stress, Strain, Temperature, etc...). Works in 2D and 3D.\n- Extract stress-strain information for UCS and BD Simulations (Works in 2D and 3D). Optional addition of virtual strain gauges (Limited to 2D).\n- Plotting stress vs strain curve.\n- Calculate the Elastic Modulus of the dataset. Eavg, Esec and Etan can be evaluated. Works in 2D and 3D.\n- Extract information of a particular cell based on a sequence of array names. This can be extended to extracting information along a line. Works in 2D and 3D.\n- Extract information of a threshold dataset criteria based on a sequence of array names. Works in 2D and 3D.\n- Extract mesh information and plot rosette/polar plots. Limited to 2D.\n- Automatic detection/ User-defined assigment of loading direction when analysing mechanical simulations, namely UCS, BD, and PLT, in both 2D and 3D simulations.\n\n## How to use it - Terminal\n\n1. After installation is complete, in a terminal/cmd session where you keep your Python projects, type the following command:\n    ```python\n    python\n    ```\n2. In terminal, import the module like so:\n    ```python \n    import pyfdempp as fd\n    ```\n3. Specify the path to folder where your models (.vtk, .vtu files) are located on your machine.\n    ```python\n    model = fd.Model(\"abs_model_path_on_machine\")\n    ```\n4. You are ready to start using openfdem! See the operating module for full description of functions available.\n\n## Example OpenFDEM Functions\n1. Getting number of points in your model:\n    ```python\n    model.n_points\n    ```\n   Output:\n   ```python\n   11904\n   ```\n\n2. Getting the stress-strain for platen:\n   ```python\n   model.complete_stress_strain(progress_bar=True)\n   ```\n   Output:\n   ```python\n       >>> Script Identifying Platen\n       >>> Platen Material ID found as [1]\n       >>> Progress: |//////////////////////////////////////////////////| 100.0% Complete\n       >>> 1.51 seconds\n           Platen Stress  Platen Strain\n       0    0.000000e+00       0.000000\n       1    4.825237e+00       0.009259\n       2    9.628823e+00       0.018519\n       3    1.441437e+01       0.027778\n       4    1.919164e+01       0.037037\n       ..            ...            ...\n       57   2.036137e-30       0.240741\n       58   2.036137e-30       0.250000\n       59   2.036137e-30       0.259259\n       60   2.036137e-30       0.268519\n       61   2.036137e-30       0.277778\n\n       [62 rows x 2 columns]\n       >>> \n   ```\n\n\n\n\n\n",
