Feel free to get in touch\n\n# How to Contribute\n\nThe aim of this framework is to be a community effort that will benefit science, engineering and more.\n\nWe are actively seeking contribution in the form of users, testers, developers, and anyone else who would like to contribute.\n\n - If you have methods which can be added to the framework, [get in touch](#Get-in-Touch)!\n - If you think this framework will be useful to your research, [get in touch](#Get-in-Touch)!\n - If want to get invovled in development, [get in touch](#Get-in-Touch)!\n - Noticed a bug or other issue? [get in touch](#Get-in-Touch)!\n\n# How it Works\n\nThe VAI-Lab framework uses a modular, plugin-based architecture.\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n\n    VAI_Lab --> Module1\n    VAI_Lab --> Module2\n    VAI_Lab --> Module_n\n    Module1 --> plugin_1.1\n    Module1 --> plugin_1.2\n    Module1 --> plugin_1.m\n    Module2 --> plugin_2.1\n    Module2 --> plugin_2.2\n    Module2 --> plugin_2.m\n    Module_n --> plugin_m.1\n    Module_n --> plugin_m.2\n    Module_n --> plugin_m.n\n```\n\nEach module represents a process (e.g. Modelling) and each plugin is a specific implementation of that process (e.g. linear regression).\n\nModules can be chained, looped and modified in real-time to create a highly customisable framework for the user's requirements.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installing from package\n\nTo install the latest pip release:\n\n```\npip install vai-lab\n```\n\n### Installing from source \n\nClone this repository via HTTPS:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab.git\n```\nOR SSH:\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:AaltoPML/VAI-lab.git\n```\nChange directory\n```bash\ncd VAI-lab\n```\nCreate a virtual environment and activate it using venv\n```bash\npython3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate\n```\nor using conda\n```bash\nconda create --name vai_lab python=3.8 && conda activate vai_lab\n```\nUpgrade pip and install flit\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install -U pip flit\n```\nInstall the package\n```bash\nflit install\n```\n\n## Running Unit Tests\n\nUnit tests are run with pytest with\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\n\n\n## Launching and Examples\n\n### From Command Line\n\nTo launch the framework with the GUI:\n```bash\nvai_lab\n```\n\nTo launch the framework with an existing config file\n```bash\nvai_lab --file <path_to_config_file>\n```\n\n\n### From Code\n\nTo launch the framework with the GUI:\n\n```python\nimport vai_lab as ai\n\ncore = ai.Core()\ncore.run()\n```\n\nor to execute an existing config file:\n\n```python\nimport vai_lab as ai\n\ncore = ai.Core()\ncore.load_config_file(\"<path_to_config_file>\")\ncore.run()\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nPre-made [examples](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files) show the syntax and form of the config files and pipeline as a whole, and are the best way to get started.\n\nSome basic use-cases are provided among many others:\n - [user_feedback_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/user_feedback_demo.xml) Demonstrates manual image classification of chest X-rays\n - [canvas_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/canvas_demo.xml) Launches the canvas state-action pair visualiser and editor\n - [regression_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/regression_demo.xml) Demonstrates simple linear regression on a small set of sample data\n\n#### Launching examples:\n\nTo demonstrate the syntax for launching examples using `user_feedback_demo.xml`.\n\nUsing the command line\n\n```bash\nvai_lab --file ./examples/xml_files/user_feedback_demo.xml\n```\n\nFrom code\n\n```python\nimport vai_lab as ai\n\ncore = ai.Core()\ncore.load_config_file((\"./examples/xml_files/user_feedback_demo.xml\"))\ncore.run()\n```\n\nAbsolute paths, as well paths relative to the library's base directory can be used.\nFor library-relative paths, starting a path definition with `\"./\"` defaults to the directory `<path_to_site_packages>/vai_lab/`\n\nIn addition to path strings, the config file paths can be passed as lists or tuples of directory paths. Therefore, the above command/code are equivalent to\n\n```bash\nvai_lab --file ./examples xml_files user_feedback_demo.xml\n```\n\nand \n\n```python\nimport vai_lab as ai\n\ncore = ai.Core()\ncore.load_config_file((\"./examples\",\"xml_files\",\"user_feedback_demo.xml\"))\ncore.run()\n```\n\n\n# Defining Pipelines in GUI\n\nThe VAIL module allows to define a pipeline and the relations within by drawing a flowchart on a canvas. This canvas always starts with an `initialiser` module and an `output` module and allows to define any number of modules between these two. To do so, the user needs to define the modules and the relations between them.\n\n![PipelineLoop](./imgs/VAIL_GUI_screenshot.png)\n\n### Modules\nAt this moment, there are 7 possible modules for VAIL. `initialiser` and `output` are compulsory for the pipeline, the rest of them can be freely placed in the canvas. These are:\n - `Data processing`.\n - `Modelling`.\n - `Decision making`.\n - `User Feedback Adaptation`.\n - `Input data`.\n\nIf you click on a module and drag it you can modify its position on the canvas.\nFinally, they can be deleted by clicking on the desired module and then clicking on the `Delete selection` button.\n\n### Module joining\nEach module object has a number of circles that can be used to join two modules. The initially clicked circle will be identified as the parent and the second one as the child (the output of the father is fed to the input of the child). There can be only one connection from each circle. As of this version, if you need to edit an existing connection you need to delete one of the connected modules.\n\n### Loops\nIf you click on the canvas and drag, you can draw a rectangle that defines which modules are inside the loop. Upon releasing the button you are requested to input what type of loop you want and what condition should be fulfilled to end the loop.\n\n## Pipeline uploading via XML file\n\nThe pipeline can also be defined uploading an existing XML file. The structure of the XML file is described in the Back-end section.\n\n# Plugin Examples\n\n### `manual_input`\nRequires the user to indicate to which class the specified data corresponds to.\nIn the current example, the model needs to classify images and the model requires expert knowledge for specific images.\nThe user needs to indicate which classes correspond to the image and save the results to send them to the model.\n\n### `canvas_input`\nRequires the user to give feedback to state-action pairs.\nIt opens a tab for each interactable object in the model and either requires adding new state-action samples or to modify the existing ones.\nIn the current example, the model has two interactable objects that require feedback in two forms: (1) an _angle_ for the state and for the action or (2) a tuple of _Cartesian coordinates_ for the state and for the action. It has been adapted to be able to give feedback to any number of objects. These, at the same time, can be either `sliding` or `rotating` objects. Specifically, `sliding` refers to objects that need Cartesian feedback in a two-dimensional space, while `rotating` refers to objects that require an angle. In order to give feedback, you can choose to either move the corresponding state-action pairs on the canvas or directly edit the tree view display. This last option results in an automatic update on the canvas of the state-action location.\n\n## Defining a pipeline in XML\n\nThe pipeline structure is defined between the `pipeline` tags:\n```XML\n<pipeline>\n    ...\n</pipeline>\n```\n\n### Initialise\nThe `Initialise` tag is the dedicated entry point to the pipeline. No other entry points can be declared.\n\nCurrent options:\n - `name`: attribute for user defined name\n - `initial_data`: element for declaring directory for initial data\n - `relationships`: User defined names of modules this one is connected to\n\nExample from [canvas_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/canvas_demo.xml)\n```XML\n<Initialiser name=\"Init\">\n        <inputdata>\n            <X file=\"./examples/state-action/X_data.csv\" />\n        </inputdata>\n        <relationships>\n            <child name=\"My First UserFeedback Module\" />\n        </relationships>\n    </Initialiser>\n```\n\n### Loops\nLoop tags are used to iterate over a given set of modules until a condition is met. Loops can be nested and named.  \n\nSee [basic_operation.py](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/basic_operation.xml) for full example.\nCurrent options:\n - `type`: what variety of loop will this be: `for`, `while`, `manual`(user defined stopping condition on-the-fly)\n - `condition`: Termination condition for the loop. I'm not sure how to deal with the criteria for `while` loops\n - `name`: User defined name for loop\n```XML\n<loop type=\"for\" condition=\"10\" name=\"For Loop 1\">\n    ...\n</loop>\n```\n\n### Modules\nModules are declared by tags matching their names, e.g. the GUI module is loaded with the `GUI` tag:\n\nRequired:\n - `name`: Unique user defined name for module, so can be referenced later\n - `plugin`: The type of plugin to be loaded into the module, along with associated options.\n - `relationships`: User-defined names of the `parent` modules which this module receives data from and `child` modules that this module passes data to.\n\nExample from [ridge_regression_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/ridge_regression_demo.xml):\n```XML\n     <Modelling name=\"Modelling\">\n        <relationships>\n            <parent name=\"Initialiser\" />\n            <child name=\"Output\" />\n        </relationships>\n        <plugin type=\"RidgeRegression\">\n            <alpha>\n                 0.02\n            </alpha>\n        </plugin>\n    </Modelling>\n```\n\n## Data Definition\n\nData is loaded from existing files in either the `Initialiser` or `Input Data` modules and is specified using the `inputdata` tags.\n\nExample from [ridge_regression_demo.xml](https://github.com/AaltoPML/VAI-lab/tree/main/src/vai_lab/examples/xml_files/ridge_regression_demo.xml):\n\n```XML\n<inputdata>\n    <X file=\"./examples/supervised_regression/X_tr.csv\" />\n    <Y file=\"./examples/supervised_regression/Y_tr.csv\" />\n    <X_test file=\"./examples/supervised_regression/X_tst.csv\" />\n    <Y_test file=\"./examples/supervised_regression/Y_tst.csv\" />\n</inputdata>\n```\n\n### Writing Data\nTwo methods are given to add data to the XML file. One for modules (`append_pipeline_module_to_file`) and one for data structures (`append_data_structure_field_to_file`).\n\n# Feature and Release Schedule :calendar:\n\n- [ ] October/ November 2022: Public repo, API fixing, Testing\n- [ ] January 2023: Representative use case release\n- [ ] Spring 2023: Initial full release of manual pipeline\n- [ ] Fall 2023: Initial release of preliminary AI-Assistance\n\n# Get in Touch\nIf you would like contribute, test, give feedback, or ask questions about this framework, we'd like to hear from you!\nEmail us at:\n- Chris McGreavy, chris.mcgreavy [at] aalto.fi\n- Carlos Sevilla-Salcedo, carlos.sevillasalcedo [at] aalto.fi\n\n",
