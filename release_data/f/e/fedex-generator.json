Based on FEDEx work (https://github.com/TAU-DB/FEDEx), it gives the user the option to generate NL explanations + Visualizations to their queries (Filter/GroupBy/Join) results.\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nFEDEx generator is forked from on FEDEx system, and offer new process to get explanation:\r\n\r\n1. The user users query (filter/groupby/join), and pass to FEDEx the input dataframe, output dataframe and the query parameters.\r\n3. FEDEx calculates an Interestingness Measure (that works well with the specific operation, for example Exceptionality measure for Filter and Join operations) for every column in the output dataframe (the query result)\r\n4. FEDEx finds the most interesting columns and partition them to set of rows.\r\n5. Then it finds the set-of-rows that affects the Interesingness measure result the most (from [2]).\r\n6. Now FEDEx takes the top columns and set-of-rows and generates meaningful explanations\r\n\r\nFor the full details, you can either view the code or read the FEDEx article which will be referenced here really soon:)\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nIn FEDEx example they used the spotify dataset from Kaggle.\r\nThe first operation of our user was `SELECT * FROM Spotify WHERE popularity > 65;`\r\n\r\nThe raw output (Snip) -\r\n\r\n![Filter output](Images/filter_result.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe generated explanation -\r\n\r\n![Filter explanation](Images/filter_explanation.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe second operation of the user was `SELECT AVG(dancability), AVG(loudness) FROM [SELECT * FROM Spotify WHERE year >= 1990] GROUPBY year;`\r\n\r\nThe raw output (Snip) -\r\n\r\n![GroupBy output](Images/groupby_result.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe generated explanation -\r\n\r\n![GroupBy explanation](Images/groupby_explanation.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n**Notice** - This project was tested on python version 3.6-3.8. \r\n\r\nFirst, you have to install the requirements - `py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nSecondly, you should install latex on your system (the explanations inside the graphs require that). Things will still work even without latex but the experince might be a bit inferior.\r\n\r\nThis fork created to work on some adjusments for a API that will allow users to use pandas and generate explanations without effort and without using additional dedicated API.\r\n",
