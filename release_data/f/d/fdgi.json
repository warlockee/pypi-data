A, G are matrices acting on the two indices of X, i.e. \n![(AG)X=B](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\\normalsize&space;\\sum_{w,q}A_{iw}G_{jq}X_{wq}=B_{ij}) \n\nG is optional, by default (`G=None`) it is identity, in which case this is the conventional Spooktroscopy, i.e. to solve <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=AX=B\"> under regularizations. \n\nThe reason for G is to accommodate the combination with [pBASEX](https://github.com/e-champenois/CPBASEX), in which case this is solving the two linear inversions in one step.\n\n### Regularizations\nCommon regularizations are the following three types, all of which optional, depending on what _a prior_ knowledge one wants to enforce on the problem solving.\n\n1. Nonnegativity: To constrain <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X\\succeq 0\">\n2. Sparsity: To penalize on <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\|X\\|_1\"> or <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\|X\\|_2^2\">\n3. Smoothness: To penalize on roughness of X , along the two indices, independently. For <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\omega\">-axis, which is the photon energy axis, the form is fixed <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\|(L_{N_w}\\otimes I)X\\|_2^2\"> where <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=L_{N_w}\"> is the [laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator). Roughness along the second axis of X is customizable through parameter `Bsmoother`, which by default is laplacian squared too.\n\nSparsity and Smoothness are enforced through penalties in the total obejctive function, and the penalties are weighted by hyperparameters `lsparse` and `lsmooth`. `lsmooth` is a 2-tuple that weight roughness penalty along the two axes of X respectively. The hyperparameters can be passed in during instantiation and also updated afterwards. It is recommended to call method `getXopt` with the hyperparameter(s) to be updated, because it will update, solve, and return the optimal X in one step. Calling `solve` with  the hyperparameter(s) to be updated and then calling `getXopt()` without input is effectively the same, and the problem will be solved once as long as there is no update.\n\n## Solvers\n\nDifferent combinations of regularizations can lead to different forms of objective function. Solvers in package always formalize the specific problem into either a [Quadratic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming) or a linear equation. Examples can be found in [unit tests](#UnitTests) \n\n| Nonnegativity | Sparsity            | Smoothness | Solver              | Notes                                                        |\n| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| True          | L1 or False         | Quadratic  | `SpookPosL1`        | This solver can serve tasks like in [Li _et al_](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6455/abcdf1) |\n| True          | L2 squared          | Quadratic  | `SpookPosL2` |                                                              |\n| False         | L2 squared or False | Quadratic  | `SpookLinSolve`     | This solver is so far the work-horse for SpookVMI            |\n| False         | L1                  | Quadratic  | `SpookL1` |                                                              |\n\n\n### Quadratic Programming\n\nFor cases where it can be formalized into a [Quadratic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming) , [OSQP](https://osqp.org) does the job. Thus the root numerical method is alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Looking into the [solver settings of OSQP](https://osqp.org/docs/interfaces/solver_settings.html) is always encouraged, but the default settings usually work fine for `spook` . If one needs to pass in settings, the OSQP solver is `SpookQPBase._prob` .\n\n### Linear Equation\n\nA rare case that it can be formalized into a linear equation is the third line in the table above: no nonnegativity constraint, and the sparsity is L2 norm squared. This is implemented in `SpookLinSolve` , which calls `numpy.linalg.solve` or `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve` .\n\n\n## Normalization Convention\n\nThe entries in <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A^TA, G^TG\"> are preferred to be on the order of unity, because regularization-related quadratic form matrices have their entries around unity. The scale factors are set as\n\n![normalization](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?&space;s_a=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_w}\\mathrm{tr}(A^TA)},s_g=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_q}\\mathrm{tr}(G^TG)})\n\nwhere <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=N_w, N_q\"> are the dimensions along w-axis and q-axis, respectively. <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_as_g\"> is an accessible property of the solver `AGscale`. To normalize or not is controlled by parameter `pre_normalize` in instanciation. \n\n**By default** `pre_normalize=True`, i.e. `self._AtA` =<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A^TA/s_a^2\">, `self._GtG` =<img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=G^TG/s_g^2\">, and `self._Bcontracted` = <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(A^T \\otimes G^T)B/(s_as_g)\">. In this case, the direct solution `self.res` is scaled as <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=s_as_g X_\\mathrm{opt}\"> , but in `getXopt` the final result of <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_\\mathrm{opt}\"> is scaled back before returned.\n\nThe entries in B are not always accessible, because of the option to pass in precontracted results and in `mode='contracted'`. Therefore B is not normalized. \n\n\n## Unit Tests\n\n`unittest/testPosL1.py` is a good example to play with `SpookPosL1`.\n`unittest/testL1L2.ipynb` include good examples to play with `SpookPosL1`, `SpookPosL2`, and `SpookL1`.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nSee `requirements.txt`\n\n## Acknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES), Chemical Sciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences Division (CSGB).\n\ntest\n\n\n",
