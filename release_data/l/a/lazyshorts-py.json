(`{lazyshorts-py} e1 2 45 78`...)\n\n\n### Not tested\n\n- I don't know if running Whisper on GPU works, you could try CUDA. See `--whisper_device` and PyTorch/Whisper documentation. Also, get the CUDA enabled PyTorch as I define the CPU one in the `requirements.txt`.\n\n\n### Known issues\n\n- `moviepy` is largely unmaintained at the moment, somehow it collides with `multiprocessing` and the whole tool can crash-and-burn (as in, freeze) and you'll have to force exit. The renders still completed in my testing.\n- We could use `rich` to have nice progress bars, as currently you have to manually poll the status of the renders.\n- Cropping is just arbitrary: I wanted to use MediaPipe. It's not easy to even get it to run, but my resources were not enough. Maybe a less demanding model or cloud is needed?\n- Don't combine segments that are less than `end_time`, you'll get an exception.\n\n\n",
