            "description": "# LINIAROTE: The programming language for transvalent mathematics\r\n\r\nThe Liniarote package is a Python implementation of a command-line interface for the Liniarote programming language, an open-source programming language developed specifically to facilitate operations in transvalent mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe software is developed by Matthew E. Gladden (with support from Cognitive Firewall LLC and NeuraXenetica LLC) and is made available for use under GNU General Public License Version 3. Please see https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html.\r\n\r\n___\r\n## AN OVERVIEW OF TRANSVALENT MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of transvalent mathematics is that division by zero is permitted and generates results calculated according to certain clearly defined principles.\r\n\r\nThe symbol \u201c\u01f7\u201d is used to represent that (transvalent) number which when multiplied by 0 yields a result of 1. An equivalent way of defining \u01f7 is to state that it is the quotient generated when 1 is divided by 0.\r\n\r\nInformally, one can think of the number \u01f7 as a special type of \u201cinfinity\u201d that possesses such transcendent power that when 0 is multiplied by it, \u01f7 is capable of \u201clifting\u201d zero out of nothingness to give their product a positive value (i.e., 1). Similarly, the symbol \u201c-\u01f7\u201d is used to represent that (transvalent) number which when multiplied by 0 yields a result of -1; alternatively, -\u01f7 can be defined as the quotient generated when -1 is divided by 0.\r\n\r\nThe number \u01f7 is described as \u201cimperishable,\u201d because there is no real number that one can multiply it by in order to yield 0. (Similarly, there is no real number by which -\u01f7 can be multiplied to yield 0.)\r\n\r\nIntuitively, it is easy to suppose that attempts at dividing by zero must necessarily yield a result that is \u201cundefined,\u201d \u201cmeaningless,\u201d or \u201cabsurd\u201d and that calculations that attempt to divide by zero are inherently \u201cerroneous.\u201d From a theoretical perspective, though, the definitions that \u201c\u01f7 = 1 \u00f7 0\u201d and \u201c\u01f7 \u00d7 0 = 1\u201d are no more intrinsically absurd than (for example) the definitions that \u201ci = \u221a(-1)\u201d and \u201ci\u00b2 = -1\u201d, which are foundations of the imaginary and complex number systems \u2013 and which have facilitated countless theoretical and practical advances in diverse scientific and technological spheres. The establishment of systems like that found in transvalent mathematics simply required clear formulations of the meaning of \u201cdividing by zero\u201d and rules for interpreting the results that are generated. Frameworks with similarities to transvalent mathematics (e.g., in granting some formal meaning to division by zero) that have been developed in the last 200 years include those of the Riemann sphere (which extends the complex plane by adding a point at infinity) and the projectively extended real line.\r\n\r\n___\r\n## SELECTED AXIOMS OF TRANSVALENT MATHEMATICS\r\n\r\nAxioms of identity:\r\n\r\n`\u01f7 = 0 + \u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 = 0 - \u01f7`\\\r\n`n = n + (\u01f7 - \u01f7), where n is any real number`\r\n\r\nAxioms of non-associativity:\r\n\r\n`(\u01f7 + \u01f7) - \u01f7 = 0`\\\r\n`(\u01f7 + (\u01f7 - \u01f7) = \u01f7`\r\n\r\nAxioms of addition and subtraction:\r\n\r\n`\u01f7 + \u01f7 = \u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 - \u01f7 = -\u01f7`\\\r\n`\u01f7 - \u01f7 = 0`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 + \u01f7 = 0`\r\n\r\nAxioms of multiplication:\r\n\r\n`\u01f7 \u00d7 0 = 1`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 0 = -1`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00d7 n = \u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00d7 n = -\u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 n = -\u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 n = \u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00d7 n \u2260 0, where n is any real number`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 n \u2260 0, where n is any real number`\\\r\n`n / 0 = (n \u2013 1) + \u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`n / 0 = (n + 1) - \u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00d7 \u01f7 = \u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 \u01f7 = -\u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00d7 -\u01f7 = \u01f7`\r\n\r\nAxioms of division:\r\n\r\n`n \u00f7 0 = \u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`n \u00f7 0 = -\u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`0 \u00f7 0 = 1`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00f7 0 = \u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00f7 0 = -\u01f7`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00f7 n = \u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00f7 n = -\u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00f7 n = -\u01f7, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00f7 n = \u01f7, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`n \u00f7 \u01f7 = 0, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`n \u00f7 \u01f7 = -1, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`n \u00f7 -\u01f7 = -1, where n is any positive real number`\\\r\n`n \u00f7 -\u01f7 = 0, where n is any negative real number`\\\r\n`0 \u00f7 \u01f7 = 0`\\\r\n`0 \u00f7 -\u01f7 = -1`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00f7 \u01f7 = \u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00f7 \u01f7 = -\u01f7`\\\r\n`-\u01f7 \u00f7 -\u01f7 = \u01f7`\\\r\n`\u01f7 \u00f7 -\u01f7 = -\u01f7`\r\n\r\n___\r\n## PACKAGE EXECUTION AND INPUT FORMAT\r\n\r\nThe manner of activating the Liniarote command-line interface will depend on one's operating system and Python installation. In Windows, for example, one may be able to run the command-line interface module (cli.py) by typing at the PowerShell prompt or Visual Studio Code terminal prompt from within the appropriate folder:\r\n\r\n`python -m pip install liniarote`\\\r\n`python -m liniarote.cli`\r\n\r\nOn the Liniarote command line, the symbol \u201c\u01f7\u201d (Unicode: U+01F7; UTF-8: C7 B7) can be inputted by typing the lowercase letter \u201cw\u201d, which will be automatically converted into \u201c\u01f7\u201d during processing of the input. (Similarly, \u201c-w\u201d will be converted into \u201c-\u01f7\u201d.)\r\n\r\nThe order of entry of the real and transvalent components of a number is without significance. Thus, both \u201c3 + w\u201d and \u201cw + 3\u201d will, when inputted, be converted into \u201c3 + \u01f7\u201d, while \u201c-5 + w\u201d and \u201c-w \u2013 5\u201d and will be converted into \u201c-5 \u2013 \u01f7\u201d.\r\n\r\nInputted constants recognized by Liniarote include \u201ce\u201d and \u201cpi\u201d.\r\n\r\nDivision is not yet implemented. The operators currently available for use are: + - * ( )\r\n\r\n___\r\n## REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nPlease see the \u201crequirements.txt\u201d file for a list of other Python packages whose installation is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of Liniarote.\r\n\r\n___\r\n## INSPIRATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nWithin the world of the \u201cUtopian Confederation\u201d RPG series, the foundational text in the field of transvalent mathematics as such was published by a team of Utopian mathematicians in 1911. In honor of their work, the Liniarote programming language was named after one of the 54 cities of the ancient Utopian Commonwealth, as described in ThomasMore\u2019s \u201cUtopia\u201d (1516). Liniarote was created and is maintained by Matthew E. Gladden.\r\n\r\nLiniarote code and documentation \u00a92022-2023 Cognitive Firewall LLC\r\n",
