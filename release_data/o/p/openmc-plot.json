However you might want to host your own version locally.\n\nTo host your own local version of [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com) you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and then can build and run the Dockerfile\nwith the following commands.\n\nFirst clone the repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fusion-energy/openmc_plot\n```\n\nThen navigate into the repository folder\n```bash\ncd openmc_plot\n```\n\nThen build the docker image\n```bash\ndocker build -t openmc_plot .\n```\n\nThen run the docker image\n```bash\ndocker run --network host -t openmc_plot\n```\n\nThe URL of your locally hosted version should appear in the terminal, copy and paste this URL into a web browser address bar.\n\n# Maintenance\n\nPushing to the main branch of this repository triggers an automatic rebuild and\ndeployment of the new code using Google Cloud build at [xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com)\n",
