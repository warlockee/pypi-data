This way, you can encode your knowledge about your\npartners directly in your partner list.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nRelation Types\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore being able to use relations, you'll have define some first.\nDo that in Contacts / Relations / Partner relations.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_list.png\n\nA relation type has a name for both sides.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_form_empty.png\n\nTo have an assistant-relation, you would name one side 'is assistant of' and the other side 'has assistant'.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_form_name_filled.png\n\nPartner Types\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe `Partner Type` fields allow to constrain what type of partners can be used\non the left and right sides of the relation.\n\n* In the example above, the assistant-relation only makes sense between people, so you would choose 'Person' for both partner types.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_form_partner_type_filled.png\n\n* For a relation 'is a competitor of', both sides would be companies.\n* A relation 'has worked for' should have persons on the left side and companies on the right side.\n\nIf you leave these fields empty, the relation is applicable to all types of partners.\n\nPartner Categories\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou may use categories (tags) to further specify the type of partners.\n\nYou could for example enforce the 'is member of' relation to accept only companies with the label 'Organization' on the right side.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_form_category_filled.png\n\nReflexive\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nA reflexive relation type allows a partner to be in relation with himself.\n\nFor example, the CEO of a company could be his own manager.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_reflexive.png\n\nSymmetric\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nA symetric relation has the same value for the left and right sides.\n\nFor example, in a competitor relation, both companies are competitors of each other.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_symmetric.png\n\nInvalid Relation Handling\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWhen the configuration of a relation type changes, some relations between 2 partners may become invalid.\n\nFor example, if the left partner type is set to `Person` and a relation already exists with a company on the right side,\nthat relation becomes invalid.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/relation_type_invalid_handling.png\n\nWhat happens with invalid relations is customizable on the relation type.\n\n4 possible behaviors are available:\n\n* Do not allow change that will result in invalid relations\n* Allow existing relations that do not fit changed conditions\n* End relations per today, if they do not fit changed conditions\n* Delete relations that do not fit changed conditions\n\nSearching Partners With Relations\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo search for existing relations, go to `Contacts / Relations / Relations`.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/search_relation.png\n\nTo find all assistants in your database, fill in 'assistant' and\nautocomplete will propose to search for this type of relation.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/search_relation_2.png\n\nNow if you want to find Colleen's assistant, you fill in 'Colleen' and one of the proposals\nis to search for partners having a relation with Colleen.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/search_relation_3.png\n\nSearching Relations From Partner View\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA smart button is available on the partner form view to display the list of relations.\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/partner_form_view_smart_button.png\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/partner-contact/12.0/partner_multi_relation/static/description/partner_form_view_smart_button_2.png\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub
