The High-Bay contains many\nsub-locations.\n\nA product can be stored either in the High-Bay, either in the Shelving zone.\n\nWhen picking:\n\nWhen there is enough stock in the Shelving, you expect the moves to have the\nusual Pick(Highbay)-Pack-Ship steps. If the good is picked from the High-Bay, you will\nneed an extra operation: Pick(Highbay)-Handover-Pack-Ship.\n\nThis is what this feature is doing: on the High-Bay location, you define\na \"routing rule\". A routing rule selects a different operation type for the move.\nThe extra transfer will have the selected operation type, and be added\ndynamically, on reservation, before the chain of moves.\n\nWhen putting away:\n\nA put-away rule targets the High-Bay location.\nAn operation Input-Highbay is created. You expect Input-Handover-Highbay.\n\nYou can configure a dynamic routing for the put-away on the High-Bay Location.\nThe operation type of the new Handover move will the one of the matching routing rule,\nand its destination will be the destination of the operation type.\n\n**Table of contents**\n\n.. contents::\n   :local:\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nIn Inventory Settings, you must have:\n\n * Storage Locations\n * Multi-Warehouses\n * Multi-Step Routes\n\nA new menu in Inventory Settings allow to create new routing rules:\n\"Stock Routing\".\n\nCreate a new routing for a location, then pull or push routing rules.\nA pull rule is applied on moves with the same source location (or children).\nA push rule is applied on moves with the same destination location (or children).\n\nRules can exclude moves based on a domain. The order of the rules is important:\nthe first to match is used.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nTry on runbot\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* In Inventory Settings, activate:\n\n  * Storage Locations\n  * Multi-Warehouses\n  * Multi-Step Routes\n\nThe initial setup in the demo data contains locations:\n\n* WH/Stock/Highbay\n* WH/Stock/Highbay/Bin 1\n* WH/Stock/Highbay/Bin 2\n* WH/Stock/Handover\n\nThe \"Highbay\" location (and children) is configured to:\n\n* create a pull routing transfer from Highbay to Handover when\n  goods are taken from Highbay (using a new picking type Highbay \u2192 Handover)\n* create a push routing transfer from Handover to Highbay when\n  goods are put to Highbay (using a new picking type Handover \u2192 Highbay)\n\nSteps to try the Pull Routing Transfer:\n\n* In the main Warehouse, configure outgoing shipments to \"Send goods in output and then deliver (2 steps)\"\n* Inventory a product, for instance \"[FURN_8999] Three-Seat Sofa\", add 50 items in \"WH/Stock/Highbay/Bay A/Bin 1\", and nowhere else\n* Create a sales order with 5 \"[FURN_8999] Three-Seat Sofa\", confirm\n* You'll have 3 transfers; a new one has been created dynamically for Highbay -> Handover.\n\nSteps to try the Push Routing Transfer:\n\n* In the \"WH/Stock\" location, create a Put-Away Strategy with:\n\n  * \"[DESK0004] Customizable Desk (Aluminium, Black)\" to location \"WH/Stock/Highbay/Bay A/Bin 1\"\n  * \"[E-COM06] Corner Desk Right Sit\" to location \"WH/Stock/Shelf 1\"\n\n* Create a new purchase order of:\n\n  * 5 \"[DESK0004] Customizable Desk (Aluminium, Black)\"\n  * 5 \"[E-COM06] Corner Desk Right Sit\"\n\n* Confirm the purchase\n* You'll have 2 transfers:\n\n  * one to move DESK0004 from Supplier \u2192 Handover and E-COM06 from Supplier \u2192 Shelf 1\n  * one waiting on the other to move DESK0004 from Handover \u2192 WH/Stock/Highbay/Bay A/Bin 1 (the final location of the put-away)\n\nBug Tracker\n===========\n\nBugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/OCA/wms/issues>`_.\nIn case of trouble, please check there if your issue has already been reported.\nIf you spotted it first, help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed\n`feedback <https://github.com/OCA/wms/issues/new?body=module:%20stock_dynamic_routing%0Aversion:%2016.0%0A%0A**Steps%20to%20reproduce**%0A-%20...%0A%0A**Current%20behavior**%0A%0A**Expected%20behavior**>`_.\n\nDo not contact contributors directly about support or help with technical issues.\n\nCredits\n=======\n\nAuthors\n~~~~~~~\n\n* Camptocamp\n\nContributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Jo\u00ebl Grand-Guillaume <joel.grandguillaume@camptocamp.com>\n* Guewen Baconnier <guewen.baconnier@camptocamp.com>\n* Jacques-Etienne Baudoux (BCIM) <je@bcim.be>\n* Akim Juillerat <akim.juillerat@camptocamp.com>\n\nMaintainers\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis module is maintained by the OCA.\n\n.. image:: https://odoo-community.org/logo.png\n   :alt: Odoo Community Association\n   :target: https://odoo-community.org\n\nOCA, or the Odoo Community Association, is a nonprofit organization whose\nmission is to support the collaborative development of Odoo features and\npromote its widespread use.\n\nThis module is part of the `OCA/wms <https://github.com/OCA/wms/tree/16.0/stock_dynamic_routing>`_ project on GitHub.\n\nYou are welcome to contribute.
