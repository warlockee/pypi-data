Defaults to ``False``.\n    verify = False\n\nThe 'newrelic' section specifies the New Relic license key. Optionally you may nominate a proxy for accessing the New Relic Plugin API.\n\n::\n\n    [newrelic]\n\n    # Your NewRelic license key.\n    key = ****************************************\n\n    # Proxy (ex. http://10.10.1.10:3128).\n    http_proxy =\n\nThe 'plugin' section defines sample period for updating New Relic, as well as the logging level for emitting messages about plugin operation.\n\nThere are a set of configurations for defining which statuses are captured by New Relic, summarized below.\n\n- **summary_status** (True|False): retrieve local cluster summary status.\n- **databases** (list of databases): retrieve database detailed status.\n- **hosts_summary_status** (True|False):  retrieve summary of all hosts status.\n- **hosts** (list of hosts): retrieve host detailed status.\n- **forests_summary_status** (True|False): retrieve summary of all forests status.\n- **forests** (list of forests): retrieve forest detailed status.\n- **groups** (list of groups): retrieve group detailed status.\n- **servers_summary_status** (True|False): retrieve summary of all servers status.\n- **servers** (list of servers): retrieve server detailed status.\n\n::\n\n    [plugin]\n\n    # New Relic plugin display name.\n    name = myMarkLogicServer\n\n    # Unique New Relic plugin guid.\n    guid = com.marklogic\n\n    # Sample period in seconds.\n    duration = 60\n\n    # Set logging level (INFO|DEBUG|ERROR).\n    log_level = DEBUG\n\n    # Local cluster summary.\n    summary_status = False\n\n    # Database(s) detail status.\n    databases = Documents\n\n    # Hosts summary.\n    hosts_summary_status = True\n\n    # Host(s) detail status.\n    hosts = 127.0.0.1\n\n    # Forests summary.\n    forests_summary_status = True\n\n    # Forest(s) detail status.\n    forests = Documents Meters\n\n    # Group(s) detail status.\n    groups = Default\n\n    # Servers summary.\n    servers_summary_status = True\n\n    # Server(s) detail status (must supply group name ex. ServerName:GroupName).\n    servers = Manage:Default\n\nCreate pypi distribution\n---------------------------------------\n\n1. To create an official distribution, first ensure that all tests are passing:\n\n   ``python -m unittest discover -s tests``\n\n2. bump version number and create a distro:\n\n   ``python setup.py sdist``\n\n3. Upload the package to pypitest:\n\n   ``twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*``\n\n4. after verifying all is well, generate the distro on pypi:\n\n   ``twine upload dist/*``\n\nIssues, feature requests & contributing\n---------------------------------------\n\nPlease file `bug reports <https://github.com/marklogic-community/newrelic-plugin/issues>`__, `feature\nrequests <https://github.com/marklogic-community/newrelic-plugin/issues>`__, and contribute with `pull\nrequests <https://github.com/marklogic-community/newrelic-plugin/pulls>`__ through GitHub.\n\nCopyright & License\n-------------------\n\nnewrelic-marklogic-plugin Copyright 2019 MarkLogic Corporation\n\nnewrelic-marklogic-plugin is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\").
