You can also use the `n2md` alias\n\n```bash\nn2md notion_url\n```\n\n## Library\n\nYou can also write a script to export, programmatically. See [`example.py`](https://github.com/alvinwan/notion2markdown/blob/main/example.py).\n\n```python\nfrom notion2markdown import NotionExporter\nimport os\n\n\nexporter = NotionExporter(token=os.environ[\"NOTION_TOKEN\"])\nexporter.export_url(url='https://lvinwan.notion.site/lvinwan/Example-Notion-Page-f8deb4d042034c6c8d03b6de37a99498')\n```\n\nYou may optionally download JSON, then convert to markdown separately. This may be helpful if you want to cache downloads, for example. You can use the exporter's downloader and converter separately, like this:\n\n```python\nexporter.downloader.download_url(url)  # Download json\nexporter.converter.convert()  # Convert json to md\n```\n\nYou may also export to any directory of your choosing.\n\n```python\nexporter.export_url(url, json_dir='./my_special_directory')\n```\n\n## Why use this library?\n\nTo start, Notion's official markdown export is (1) available only via the UI and (2) buggy.\n\n### 1. Fix random asterisks\n\nLet's say we have the following piece of text. Turns out this is a pain to export to markdown correctly, from Notion's block data structure.\n\n> **Here is a sentence that was bolded *then* typed.**\n\n**Notion randomly adds a ton of asterisks.** This occurs *anytime* you edit a bolded or italicized piece of text. To reproduce: In Notion, bold a line, *then* type out that line. When you export, you'll get something like the following with random leading or trailing asterisks.\n\n```\n************************Here is a sentence that was bolded ****then**** typed.**\n```\n\n**`notion2md` generates unparse-able markdown.** `notion2md` partially solves the above problem. There are no spurious leading asterisks, but it treats every piece of text with different annotations, separately. This means it breaks the above sentence in 3 pieces, rendering bold text, then a bold-italic text, then a bold text. This leads to the following, which is *technically* correct but uninterpretable by markdown parsers:\n\n```\n**Here is a sentence that was bolded *****then***** typed.**\n```\n\nPassing either of the above markdown into markdown conversion utilities will result in spurious asterisks throughout your text. By contrast, `notion2markdown` will render the following, which renders correctly with any standard markdown engine:\n\n```\n**Here is a sentence that was bolded *then* typed.**\n```\n\nIt's worth noting that `notion2md` and the Notion markdown export both otherwise generate valid markdown. This annoying edge case bothered me enough to write this library.\n\n### 2. Export databases, with metadata\n\nNotion's official markdown export includes the title along with any properties associated with the page.\n\nThis library `notion2markdown` does the same, adding properties and the title in the same format that the official Notion export does. By contrast, `notion2md` excludes the metadata and page properties, just exporting the page content.\n\nFurthermore, `notion2markdown` can export an entire database, like Notion's official export. On the other hand, `notion2md` is designed to export individual pages. Naturally, it could be extended to export entire databases.\n\n## Develop\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:alvinwan/notion2markdown.git\npip install --editable .\n```\n\nRun tests\n\n```bash\npytest notion2markdown --doctest-modules\n```\n",
