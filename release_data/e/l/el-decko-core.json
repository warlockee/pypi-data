            "description": "# El Decko Core\nThis is the core of El Decko.  \nIt serves as the glue between any backend, the Stream Deck  and any given user interface.\n\nIf writing news user interfaces please target the core instead of using any or multiple backends directly.  \nAlso don't provide Stream Deck related functionality directly in the UI but seek to add missing stuff here.\n\n![El Decko concept](examples/el_decko_concept.svg \"El Decko concept\")\n\n## Develop El Decko\nIf you're using virtualenv to develop El Decko I advise to not use separate venvs for each component but to install them  \nall in the same environment simply do the following: `pip install --editable .` on all backends, the core and UIs  \nand simply use them as they were properly installed on your system.  \nSince in development modules can't be pushed to the pip registry this is, afaik, the best way to develop and test all  \ncomponents together.  \nChanges on the python code will take effect imminently.  \nOnly if you change the pyproject.toml files you need to re-run `pip install --editable .` to let this  \nchanges take effect.\n\n### lib-hidapi and flatpak\nIf you happen to run PyCharm from flatpak (as I do) it will not be able to access `libhidapi-libusb.so` from the host.  \nTo workaround this issue simply run `pip install --editable .` in a terminal on your host OS which is not sandboxed by  \nflatpak.  \nUntil I found a way to resolve this issue inside the flatpak runtime El Decko can't be provided as a flatpak. :/  \nI am really sorry for this.\n\n## Standalone\nIf you do not want to run El Decko using any UI but just want it to sit silently in the background and waiting for key press events on your Stream Deck you can run it as a stand-alone program after installing it via pip as follows: `ed-core`  \nBut keep in mind that any change on your configuration files will require you to quit and restart El Decko manually and don't close the terminal window as this might exit the program as well.  \n\n### First run\nUpon the first run El Decko Core will create an empty default configurations file at `$XDG_CONFIG/eldecko`.  \nThe default path is: `$HOME/.config/eldecko`\n\n## Available backends\n- [OBS Studio Websocket](https://github.com/Z-Ray-Entertainment/el_decko_backend_obs_ws)\n  * This backend function by using OBS Studios websocket server.\n  * This way it is display server agnostic\n  * You need to enable the websocket server inside OBS and supply the plugin with the generated password.\n",
