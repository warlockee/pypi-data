            "description": "# PyTorch with DirectML\nDirectML acceleration for PyTorch is currently available for Public Preview. PyTorch with DirectML enables training and inference of complex machine learning models on a wide range of DirectX 12-compatible hardware.\n\nDirectML is a high-performance, hardware-accelerated DirectX 12 library for machine learning. DirectML provides GPU acceleration for common machine learning tasks across a broad range of supported hardware and drivers, including all DirectX 12-capable GPUs from vendors such as AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm.\n\nMore information about DirectML can be found in [Introduction to DirectML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3d12/dml-intro).\n\nPyTorch on DirectML is supported on both the latest versions of Windows 10 and the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about), and is available for download as a PyPI package. For more information about getting started, see [GPU accelerated ML training (docs.microsoft.com)](http://aka.ms/gpuinwsldocs)\n\n\n## Samples\nRefer to the [Pytorch with DirectML Samples Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML/tree/master/PyTorch) for samples. \n\n## Feedback\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you!\n\n* For TensorFlow with DirectML issues, bugs, and feedback; or for general DirectML issues and feedback, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML-Samples/issues) or contact us directly at askdirectml@microsoft.com.\n\n* For PyTorch with DirectML issues, bugs, and feedback; or for general DirectML issues and feedback, please [file an issue](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectML-Samples/issues) or contact us directly at askdirectml@microsoft.com.\n\n* For Windows ML issues, please file a GitHub issue at [microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-Machine-Learning/issues) or contact us directly at askwindowsml@microsoft.com.\n\n* For ONNX Runtime issues, please file an issue at [microsoft/onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide\na CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment).

Avoid pushing identical changes twice into release and main.\n2. Avoid to be blocked by broken changes from pytorch master.\n\nExamples of cutting branches:\n1. A new branch for pytorch-1.13 (e.g. [release/1.13+2]) will be cut from the last released branch [release/1.13+](https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/WindowsAI/_git/pytorch-directml-plugin?path=/&version=GBrelease/1.13) for new releases, and developers will stay on the new branch daily until that release is published.\n\n2. For new pytorch version **1.13.1**, release/1.13.1 should be cut from main **after** all release  workloads are RIed.\n\n![workflow](/docs/workflow.png)\n\n## External Links\n\n[PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/)\n",
