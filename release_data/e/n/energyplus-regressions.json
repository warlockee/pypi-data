A couple statements ahead of this:\n - When we create the standalone installer, we use `pyinstaller` to _freeze_ the program and all dependencies.\n - When we run EnergyPlus, we have to run in multiple processes, not just multiple threads, because of thread-unsafety within EnergyPlus itself.\n\nThere is an issue with the combination of these two things that cause the program to not work well on Windows and Mac.\nIf you try to freeze the program but use the multiprocessing library to create child instances, it fails.\nThere are notes on the web about how to remedy this by calling special functions at the entry of the code, but I could not get them to work fully.\nSo for now, if you use the frozen downloadable version of the program on Windows or Mac, it will not run EnergyPlus in multiple processes.\n\nHowever, if you install the library into a Python install using Pip, the program is never frozen using `pyinstaller`, and seems to work just fine across platforms even with multiprocessing.\nThe best install path is to run in that fashion, but if you cannot, you can download the frozen version and just accept the single process for now.\n\n## Development\n\nFor setting up a development environment to do _work_ on this tool, the steps are pretty minimal:\n - Install Python, if needed\n - Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlusRegressionTool`)\n - Install dependencies (`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)\n\n## Documentation\n\nProgram documentation, including user guide and typical workflows, are available in the documentation.\nThis documentation is written using RST with Sphinx, and published on [ReadTheDocs](https://energyplusregressiontool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Testing\n\nExhaustive unit tests have been added to the \"underneath the hood\" code, like the functions that calculate diffs and run builds.\nThe unit tests are run on [Github Actions](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlusRegressionTool/actions).\nThe GUI code is not unit tested, but tested routinely on all platforms.\n\n\n",
