It should make clear where this fits in to the overall Open edX\ncodebase and should be oriented towards people who are new to the Open edX\nproject.\n\nGetting Started\n***************\n\nDeveloping\n==========\n\nOne Time Setup\n--------------\n.. code-block::\n\n  # Clone the repository\n  git clone git@github.com:iloveagent57/edx-ledger.git\n  cd edx-ledger\n\n  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it\n  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 edx-ledger\n  # or with pyenv\n  pyenv virtualenv 3.8 edx-ledger\n\n\nEvery time you develop something in this repo\n---------------------------------------------\n.. code-block::\n\n  # Activate the virtualenv\n  workon edx-ledger\n  # or with pyenv\n  pyenv activate edx-ledger\n\n  # Grab the latest code\n  git checkout main\n  git pull\n\n  # Install/update the dev requirements\n  make requirements\n\n  # Run just the tests\n  make test\n\n  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)\n  make validate\n\n  # Make a new branch for your changes\n  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>\n\n  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.\n  vim ...\n\n  # Run your new tests\n  pytest ./tests/new_tests.py\n\n  # Run all the tests and quality checks\n  make validate\n\n  # Commit all your changes\n  git commit ...\n  git push\n\n  # Open a PR and ask for review.\n\nDeploying\n=========\n\nTODO: How can a new user go about deploying this component?
