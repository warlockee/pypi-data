            "description": "# Ease.ml/Datascope: Guiding your Data-centric Data Iterations, over End-to-end ML pipelines\n\nDeveloping ML applications are data-centric --- often *the quality of your model\nis a reflection of the quality of your underlying data*. In the era of data\ncentric AI, the fundemental question becomes\n\n  > _Which training data example is most important to improve the accuracy/fairness of my ML model?_\n\nOnce you know these \"importances\", we can use it to support a range of applications ---\nclean your data and fix your data bugs, data acquisition, data summarization, etc. \n(e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07128.pdf). \n\nDataScope is a tool for inspecting ML pipelines by measuring how important each \ntraining data point is. The most prominent feature of DataScope is that it \nsupports not only a single ML model, but also on any `sklearn` Pipeline --- it is \nalso super fast, up to four orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches.\nThe secret sauce of DataScope is a collection of new results on computing\nthe Shapley value of a specific family of ML models (K-nearest neighbor classiifers)\nin PTIME, over relational data provenances. If you want to learn more about how DataScope works, \nthe main reference is https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11131, and a series of our previous studies on\nKNN Shapley proxies can be found at https://ease.ml/datascope.\n\nIn just seconds, you will be able to get the importance score for each of your \ntraining example, and get your data-centric cleaning/debugging iterations\nstarted!\n\nDataScope is part of the Ease.ML data-centric ML DevOps eco-system: https://Ease.ML\n\n## References\n\n```\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2204.11131,\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11131},\n  author = {Karla\u0161, Bojan and Dao, David and Interlandi, Matteo and Li, Bo and Schelter, Sebastian and Wu, Wentao and Zhang, Ce},\n  title = {Data Debugging with Shapley Importance over End-to-End Machine Learning Pipelines},\n  publisher = {arXiv}, year = {2022},\n}\n```\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nInstall by running:\n\n```bash\npip install datascope\n```\n\nWe can compute the Shapley importance scores for some scikit-learn pipeline `pipeline` using a training dataset `(X_train, y_train)` and a valiation dataset `(X_val, y_val)` as such:\n\n```python\nfrom datascope.importance.common import SklearnModelAccuracy\nfrom datascope.importance.shapley import ShapleyImportance\n\nutility = SklearnModelAccuracy(pipeline)\nimportance = ShapleyImportance(method=\"neighbor\", utility=utility)\nimportances = importance.fit(X_train, y_train).score(X_val, y_val)\n```\n\nThe variable `importances` contains Shapley values of all data examples in `(X_train, y_train)` computed using the nearest neighbor method (i.e. `\"neighbor\"`).\n\nFor a more complete example workflow, see the [demo Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1faCvkKLFA7m4kj8GzxBNBMMq0nXi70H3?usp=sharing).\n\n## Why datascope?\n\nShapley values help you find faulty data examples ***much faster*** than if you were going about it randomly. For example, let's say you are given a dataset with 50% of labels corrupted, and you want to repair them one by one. Which one should you select first?\n\n![Example data repair workflow using datascope](/dev/assets/uci-stdscaler-pipeline-experiment.png)\n\nIn the above figure we run different methods for prioritizing data examples that should get repaired (random selection, various methods that use the Shapley importance). After each repair, we measure the accuracy achieved on an XGBoost model. We can see in the left figure that each importance-based method is better than random. Furthermore, for the KNN method (i.e. the `\"neighbor\"` method), we are able to achieve peak performance after repairing only 50% of labels.\n\n> ease.ml/datascope speeds up data debugging by allowing you to focus on the most important data examples first\n\nIf we look at speed (right figure), we measure three different methods (the `\"neighbor\"` method and the `\"montecarlo\"` method for 10 iterations and 100 iterations). We can see that our KNN-based importance computation method is orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art MonteCarlo method.\n\n> The \"neighbor\" method in ease.ml/datascope can compute importances in seconds for datasets of several thousand examples\n",
