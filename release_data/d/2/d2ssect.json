You need the jellyfish program and also the jellyfish libraries.  To check that jellyfish is installed you can do;\n```bash\njellyfish --version\n```\nWhich should return a version > 2. In addition, you need the jellyfish libraries and headers. If you installed jellyfish via `conda` or by compiling from source these will be present in the right locations.  If you installed it your linux package manager they probably won't be present. \n\nIf you do not want to use `conda` we recommend installing Jellyfish from source.  Once done you should then be able to install `d2ssect` using pip\n\n```bash\npip3 install d2ssect\n```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nLets say we have a collection of fasta files corresponding to sequencing reads from samples that we want to compare with `d2ssect`.  First count kmers in these files using `jellyfish`\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.fasta;do jellyfish count -m 21 -s 10000000 $f -o ${f%.fasta}.jf ;done\n```\n\nNote that the command above will create a corresponding `.jf` file for every `.fasta` file in the current directory. By keeping the base names of the `jf` and `fasta` files identical we can then run `d2ssect` as follows;\n\n```bash\npython3 ../d2ssect/d2ssect/main.py -l *.jf -f *.fasta\n```\n\n\n## Building from source\n\n```\nCC=g++ pip install .\n```\n",
