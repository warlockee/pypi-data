It can be included as a Python library or it can be used via the command line.\n\nDettectinator provides plugins to read detections from your SIEM or EDR and create a DeTT&CT YAML for it, so that you can use it to visualize your ATT&CK detection coverage in the ATT&CK  Navigator.\n\nCurrently de CLI is limited to processing detections through these plugins, the library can also be used for processing data sources.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://github.com/siriussecurity/dettectinator) for more information on how to use it.\n",
