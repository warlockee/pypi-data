With our wheel built, we then only need to install it\n\n```bash\npip install .\n```\n\nwith which we then have the latest version of Hydrogym, and all of its dependencies inside of the virtualenv, installed.\n\n```bash\nsource $VENV/bin/activate\n```\n\nIf you try to run something and get an error like \"python: command not found\" you probably missed this step.\n\nThen you can get running in the interpreter as easy as:\n\n\n```python\nimport hydrogym as gym\nenv = gym.env.CylEnv(Re=100) # Cylinder wake flow configuration\nfor i in range(num_steps):\n\taction = 0.0   # Put your control law here\n    (lift, drag), reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n```\n\nOr to test that you can run things in parallel, try to run the steady-state Newton solver on the cylinder wake with 4 processors:\n\n```bash\ncd /home/hydrogym/examples/cylinder\nmpiexec -np 4 python solve-steady.py\n```\n\nFor more detail, check out:\n\n* A quick tour of features in `notebooks/overview.ipynb`\n* Example codes for various simulation, modeling, and control tasks in `examples`\n\n# Flow configurations\n\nThere are currently a number of main flow configurations, the most prominent of which are:\n\n- Periodic cyclinder wake at Re=100\n- Chaotic pinball at Re=130\n- Open cavity at Re=7500\n\nwith visualizations of the flow configurations available in the [docs](docs/FlowConfigurations.md). For the time being the cylinder wake is the most well-developed flow configuration, although the pinball should also be pretty reliable.  The cavity is in development (the boundary conditions are a little iffy and there's no actuation implemented yet) and the backwards-facing step is still planned.\n",
