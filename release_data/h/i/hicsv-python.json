But again, there is no text-based, \nhuman-readable format with embedded metadata. \n\n*hicsv* format has been developed as a solution to the above problem. \nIt is basically just a CSV table with a JSON header part attached \nat the top. The rough, tentative specification of *hicsv* is as follows. \n\n1. It should be a Unicode text file. \n\n2. It starts with consequtive lines starting with ``#``. \n\n3. The last one of the ``#``-capped lines represents the \"keys\" of each column \n   in the table. \n\n4. The rest of the ``#``-capped lines are an indented JSON which represents\n   the dictionary of metadata. \n\n5. The lines not starting with ``#`` are the CSV table. \n   The CSV part follows the generally accepted conventions\n   (mostly RFC 4180 but may not be strict)\n   except for following additional restrictions. \n\n6. The columns in the CSV table should always be of the same length. \n\n7. Each column must consist of only one type. \n\n## Example of *hicsv* format\n\n```\n#{\n#    \"some metadata entry\": \"some metadata\",\n#    \"it can be anything\": {\n#        \"that\": \"can be made into a JSON file\",\n#        \"for example\": \"a dictionary\"\n#    },\n#    \"\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\": \"\u30e6\u30cb\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u6587\u5b57\u3082OK\",\n#    \"hicsv-python version\": \"0.0.0\",\n#    \"hicsv version\": \"20220812\"\n#}\n#\"first column\"     ,\"2nd column\",\"column 3\",\"\u56db\u756a\u76ee\u306e\u30ab\u30e9\u30e0\"\n0.391006442374058   ,0           ,\"string\"  ,\"\u3044\u3061\"     \n0.6943031206081407  ,1           ,\"is\"      ,\"\u306b\"      \n0.03433735164688634 ,2           ,\"also\"    ,\"\u3055\u3093\"     \n0.015028457129899642,3           ,\"OK\"      ,\"\u3088\u3093\"     \n0.5900201005940872  ,4           ,\"!\"       ,\"\u3054\"      \n```\n\n## Scope of this package\n\nThe ``hicsv`` package is a minimal implementation of the I/O interface \nto the *hicsv*-formatted files. \nIt, therefore, does not have (or aim for) any advanced functionalities. \nPlease use ``numpy`` and/or other useful packages for anything beyond I/O. \n\n## Example\n\nTo read a hicsv-formatted text file,\n```python\nimport hicsv\nd = hicsv.hicsv(\"foo.txt\")\n```\nOr you can just create an empty object to which \nyou can add columns and header info. \n```python\ne = hicsv.hicsv()\n```\nYou can get one or more columns. \n```python\nc1, c2 = d.ga(\"column 1\", \"column 2\")\n```\n\nThe header info is stored as a dictionary. \nYou can set and get information at any time::\n```python\nd.h[\"new header entry\"] = \"some value\"\nprint(d.h[\"new header entry\"])\n```\nIf you need to create a hicsv-formatted file from scratch::\n```python\nout = hicsv()\n```\nTo add a column::\n```python\nout.append_column(\"column 1\", arr)\n```\n\nHere ``arr`` should be a 1-d numpy array. \nNote that all columns must be of the same length, \nso adding an array with different length will cause error. \nThen you can write into a hicsv-formatted text file like::\n\n```python\nout.save(\"new hicsv file.txt\")\n```\n\n## Note\nSome users may find the following behavior of this package unexpected. \n\n1. The parser deletes the spaces at the beginning and at the end of each cell. \n   This is true even if the cell content is double-quoted. \n   For example, the two cells\n\n        \"spam\", \"  spam  \"\n\n   results in identical strings. \n",
