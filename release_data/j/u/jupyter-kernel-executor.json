You may use\n`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo to your local environment\n# Change directory to the jupyter_kernel_executor directory\n# Install package in development mode\npip install -e .\n# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab\njupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n# Server extension must be manually installed in develop mode\njupyter server extension enable jupyter_kernel_executor\n# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes\njlpm build\n```\n\nYou can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.\n\n```bash\n# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed\njlpm watch\n# Run JupyterLab in another terminal\njupyter lab\n```\n\nWith the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).\n\nBy default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\njupyter lab build --minimize=False\n```\n\n### Development uninstall\n\n```bash\n# Server extension must be manually disabled in develop mode\njupyter server extension disable jupyter_kernel_executor\npip uninstall jupyter_kernel_executor\n```\n\nIn development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`\ncommand. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`\nfolder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `jupyter_kernel_executor` within that folder.\n\n### Testing the extension\n\n#### Server tests\n\nThis extension is using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for Python code testing.\n\nInstall test dependencies (needed only once):\n\n```sh\npip install -e \".[test]\"\n```\n\nTo execute them, run:\n\n```sh\npytest -vv -r ap --cov jupyter_kernel_executor\n```\n\n#### Frontend tests\n\nThis extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.\n\nTo execute them, execute:\n\n```sh\njlpm\njlpm test\n```\n\n#### Integration tests\n\nThis extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).\nMore precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.\n\nMore information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.\n\n### Packaging the extension\n\nSee [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)\n",
