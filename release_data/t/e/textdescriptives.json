TextDescriptives can be used to calculate several descriptive statistics, readability metrics, and metrics related to dependency distance. \n\n# \ud83d\udd27 Installation\n`pip install textdescriptives`\n\n# \ud83d\udcf0 News\n\n* Version 2.0 out with a new API, a new component, updated documentation, and tutorials! Components are now called by \"`textdescriptives/{metric_name}`. New `coherence` component for calculating the semantic coherence between sentences. See the [documentation](https://github.com/HLasse/TextDescriptives) for tutorials and more information!  \n\n# \u26a1 Quick Start\n\nImport the library and add the component(s) to your pipeline using the standard spaCy syntax. Available components are *descriptive_stats*, *readability*, *dependency_distance*, *pos_proportions*, *coherence*, and *quality* prefixed with `textdescriptives/`. \n\nIf you want to add all components you can use the shorthand `textdescriptives/all`.\n\n\n```py\nimport spacy\nimport textdescriptives as td\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\nnlp.add_pipe(\"textdescriptives/all\") \ndoc = nlp(\"The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it.\")\n\n# access some of the values\ndoc._.readability\ndoc._.token_length\n```\n\nTextDescriptives includes convenience functions for extracting metrics to a Pandas DataFrame or a dictionary.\n\n```py\ntd.extract_dict(doc)\ntd.extract_df(doc)\n```\n|    | text                      |   first_order_coherence |   second_order_coherence
