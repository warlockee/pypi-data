            "description": "# textual-astview\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davep/textual-astview/main/img/astview.png)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is a combination of a [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) widget\nlibrary and also a command line tool. The aim is to provide tools for\ndisplaying and exploring the [Python\nAST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html).\n\n## It's early days\n\nThis is a very early release of this code, it's still very much a work in\nprogress. This means things may change and break; it's also sitting atop\nTextual which is, of course, still undergoing rapid development. As much as\npossible I'll try and ensure that it's always working with the latest stable\nrelease of Textual.\n\nAlso, because it's early days... while I love the collaborative aspect of\nFOSS, I'm highly unlikely to be accepting any non-trivial PRs at the moment.\nDeveloping this is a learning exercise for me, it's a hobby project, and\nit's also something to help me further test Textual (disclaimer for those\nwho may not have gathered, I am employed by\n[Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/)).\n\nOn the other hand: I'm *very* open to feedback and suggestions so don't\nhesitate to engage with me [in\nDiscussions](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/discussions), or if\nit's a bug,[in Issues](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/issues). I\ncan't and won't promise that I'll take everything on board (see above about\nhobby project, etc), but helpful input should help make this as useful as\npossible in the longer term.\n\n## Installing\n\nThe package can be installed with `pip` or related tools, for example:\n\n```sh\n$ pip install textual_astview\n```\n\nAs well as the library (which I'll give some minimal documentation for below\n-- hopefully more comprehensive documentation will follow eventually), a\ncommand is also installed called `astare`. This can be used to load up and\nexplore a Python source file.\n\nAt the moment `astare` has a very simple interface, you run it passing the\nname of a Python file, explore it, quit, load it with a new file, wash,\nrinse, repeat. Yes, something a wee bit more sophisticated is on the cards\n(see the TODO section below).\n\n## The library\n\nIn the library you'll find the following Textual widgets:\n\n### `ASTView`\n\nThis is the main AST tree view. Create it by passing a Python `Path` object\nfor the file you want it to display.\n\n### `Source`\n\nThis is a widget that shows the source code for a Python file. Create this\nby also passing it a Python `Path` object for the file you want it to\ndisplay. It, of course, only really makes sense to have it show the same\nfile as the `ASTView` it'll work in concert with.\n\n### `NodeInfo`\n\nThis is a widget that is intended to be used as a footer bar, of sorts,\ngiving a summary of where an `ASTView` is focused.\n\n## Putting the widgets together\n\nThe way they all work is far from final, so the best way to get an idea of\nhow to use them, right now, is to take a look at [the code for\n`astare`](https://github.com/davep/textual-astview/blob/main/textual_astview/app/astare.py).\nThere's not a whole lot to it (right now anyway) so hopefully it'll be easy\nenough to follow.\n\n## TODO\n\nIf you're seeing this that means I decided to release so folk can have a\nplay. There's a bunch of stuff I still want to do but it can be out there\nand available and then have this sorted.\n\n- [X] Add some actual error checking around loading the file.\n- [ ] Test on Windows.\n- [ ] Test on GNU/Linux.\n- [ ] Dial in the colour and style until I'm really happy with it.\n  - [ ] Add some styling options for `NodeInfo`.\n  - [ ] Think about which styles should end stay in `DEFAULT_CSS` and which\n        should go into an app-level CSS -- this might be a bit all over the\n        place right now.\n- [ ] More navigation features.\n  - [ ] Lots of keyboard navigation coverage.\n  - [ ] Searching.\n- [ ] Extend and test all the styling options.\n- [ ] Allow loading another file without leaving the app.\n- [ ] A more \"rainbow\" approach to highlighting the source and tree\n      position.\n- [ ] Add support for setting the [source style](https://pygments.org/styles/).\n- [ ] Add a dark/light mode toggle to `astare`.\n- [ ] Better handle really long \"paths\" in `NodeInfo`.\n- [ ] In `astare` allow resizing of the panes.\n- [ ] Keep on having fun hacking on it.\n- [ ] Other stuff. I'm sure there's other stuff.\n\n[//]: # (README.md ends here)\n",
