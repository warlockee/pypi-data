            "description": "# TelegramBackup\n\nThis is the Telegram adapter for [tg-blog](https://github.com/one-among-us/tg-blog), a front-end for displaying telegram (or any compatible) channel data as an interactive web page.\n\n#### Motivation\n\nTelegram has become increasingly fragile, recently [revoking usernames for inactive channels](https://t.me/tginfoen/1471), and often randomly banning regular users misclassified as spam. During the username revoking, many channels of deceased individuals have been remove from public space, no longer accessible using `t.me` links. This tool helps to maintain Telegram channel data in case of an accidental event, and also to publicly display inactive channels that have been revoked.\n\n#### Demos / Examples\n\n* You can add this to your blog so that it syncs with your telegram channel (e.g. [Azalea's Blog](https://aza.moe/life)).\n* You can also use this to back up and display another person's channel (e.g. One Among Us (TODO)).\n\n## Usage\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst, install Python `>= 3.11`. Then, run `pip install tgc`\n\nThen, to support video/animation/sticker conversion, you have to install the following non-python dependencies:\n\n1. Install Node 19.2 and yarn 1.22\n2. `yarn global add puppeteer-lottie-cli`\n3. Install `ffmpeg` using your system package manager\n\n### Mode 1: Convert Telegram Export\n\nIf you only need a one-time export, you can use mode 1. To do this, you first need to export a channel using [tdesktop](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop).\n\nTo convert an export file into a format supported by [tg-blog](https://github.com/one-among-us/tg-blog), you can run `tgce <export path>`\n\n### Mode 2: Crawl Channel using MTProto API\n\nIf you have the permission to add a bot account to a channel, or invite a self-bot account, you can use the MTProto crawler for automatic incremental export updates. (**Please, do not log into your own Telegram account for crawling**, there's a very high chance of being mis-classified as spam and get banned)\n\nUsing this method, it can automatically update the channel backup incrementally, and the information will be more complete. However, it is more difficult to set up than mode 1.\n\n#### Setup API Keys\n\n1. Obtain `api_id` and `api_hash` by creating your Telegram application ([Official Guide](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id))\n    1. Log into https://my.telegram.org/apps\n    2. Fill out the form to create an application\n    3. Or, if you want to go against Telegram's EULA for your convenience, you can leave them blank to use Telegram's official client's API hash at your own risk.\n2. Choose which type of account to log in:\n    1. **Bot account**: Create a bot using the [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) bot.\n    2. **Self-bot account**: Leave `bot_token` blank, it will prompt you to login. You should only use a self-bot when you're not the admin of the channel (because inviting a bot requires admin access).\n3. Fill in the tokens in `~/.config/tgc/config.toml` as shown below\n\n```toml\n# Telegram API id & hash\napi_id = 10000000\napi_hash = \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n\n# Telegram bot token (leave blank to log into self-bot account)\nbot_token = \"0000000000:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n```\n\nAfter setting up the keys, you can proceed to setting up the channel:\n\n#### Setup Channels to be Crawled\n\n1. Either invite your bot to the channel or join the channel on your self-bot account\n2. Forward a channel message to [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to obtain the channel ID. (You'll see a JSON response, and you can find the ID from the `forward_from_chat` field)\n3. Fill in the channel info in `~/.config/tgc/config.toml` as shown below\n\n```toml\n# One export entry in a list of exports\n[[exports]]\nchat_id = -1001191767119    # Telegram channel chat id\npath = \"exports/hykilp\"     # Output Path\n```\n\nAfter all setup is complete, you can proceed to running the crawler.\n\n#### Running the Crawler\n\nSimply run the `tgc` command.\n\n## Automatic Updates using GitHub Actions\n\nIf you want to automatically backup/sync telegram channel data using GitHub Actions, you can do this. [Example repo](https://github.com/hykilpikonna/blog-data)\n\n1. Create a repo\n2. Add the workflow below to `.github/workflows/tgc.yml`\n3. Create file `requirements.txt` and write `tgc` in it\n4. In the Settings tab, create a secret called `TGC_CONFIG`, and paste your `config.toml` there.\n",
