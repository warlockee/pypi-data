[<a href=\"publications/ISPOPEN2021-security-predicates-vishnyakov.pdf\">paper</a>] [<a href=\"publications/ISPOPEN2021-slide-security-predicates-vishnyakov.pdf\">slide</a>]<br />\n <b>Authors</b>: A.Vishnyakov, V.Logunova, E.Kobrin, D.Kuts, D.Parygina, A.Fedotov<br />\n <b>Abstract</b>: <em>Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) is a powerful method for\n path exploration during hybrid fuzzing and automatic bug detection. We propose\n security predicates to effectively detect undefined behavior and memory access\n violation errors. Initially, we symbolically execute program on paths that\n don\u2019t trigger any errors (hybrid fuzzing may explore these paths). Then we\n construct a symbolic security predicate to verify some error condition. Thus, we\n may change the program data flow to entail null pointer dereference, division\n by zero, out-of-bounds access, or integer overflow weaknesses. Unlike static\n analysis, dynamic symbolic execution does not only report errors but also\n generates new input data to reproduce them. Furthermore, we introduce function\n semantics modeling for common C/C++ standard library functions. We aim to model\n the control flow inside a function with a single symbolic formula. This assists\n bug detection, speeds up path exploration, and overcomes overconstraints in\n path predicate. We implement the proposed techniques in our dynamic symbolic\n execution tool Sydr. Thus, we utilize powerful methods from Sydr such as path\n predicate slicing that eliminates irrelevant constraints. <br />\n\n We present Juliet Dynamic to measure dynamic bug detection tools accuracy. The\n testing system also verifies that generated inputs trigger sanitizers. We\n evaluate Sydr accuracy for 11 CWEs from Juliet test suite. Sydr shows 95.59%\n overall accuracy. We make Sydr evaluation artifacts publicly available to\n facilitate results reproducibility.</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Towards Symbolic Pointers Reasoning in Dynamic Symbolic Execution</b><br />\n <b>Talk at</b>: Ivannikov Memorial Workshop, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, 2021. [<a href=\"publications/IVMEM2021-symbolic-pointers-kuts.pdf\">paper</a>] [<a href=\"publications/IVMEM2021-slide-symbolic-pointers-kuts.pdf\">slide</a>]<br />\n <b>Authors</b>: Daniil Kuts<br />\n <b>Abstract</b>: <em>Dynamic symbolic execution is a widely used technique for\n automated software testing, designed for execution paths exploration and\n program errors detection. A hybrid approach has recently become widespread,\n when the main goal of symbolic execution is helping fuzzer increase program\n coverage. The more branches symbolic executor can invert, the more useful it is\n for fuzzer. A program control flow often depends on memory values, which are\n obtained by computing address indexes from user input. However, most DSE tools\n don't support such dependencies, so they miss some desired program branches. We\n implement symbolic addresses reasoning on memory reads in our dynamic symbolic\n execution tool Sydr. Possible memory access regions are determined by either\n analyzing memory address symbolic expressions, or binary searching with\n SMT-solver. We propose an enhanced linearization technique to model memory\n accesses. Different memory modeling methods are compared on the set of\n programs. Our evaluation shows that symbolic addresses handling allows to\n discover new symbolic branches and increase the program coverage.</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>QSynth: A Program Synthesis based Approach for Binary Code Deobfuscation</b><br />\n <b>Talk at</b>: BAR, San Diego, California, 2020.
