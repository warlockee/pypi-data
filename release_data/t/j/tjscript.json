If so, you know what the kind of video games it is.  \n**Nekopara** is the visual novel, and every visual novel nowadays are based on **RenPy**\nvisual novel engine, as you may be heard. Some people even use **Unity** for that, but...  \nAnyways, **Nekopara** is based on a **modified** version of **KrKrX** visual novel engine.\nThere are also a lot of other good novels based on that engine as well... But it's a lyric.  \n\nSo what's the **PJScript** project is for? **KrKrX** engine has two primary components. Hm...\nHave you heard about Electron desktop applications? They are regular web-sites. but have a specific\nJS runtime and their interface is written in HTML/CSS. Well, **KrKrX** architecture is a bit similar to this.  \nBut **KrKrX** does not use either plain JS or HTML/CSS. This engine has its own analogues: **TJS** and **KAG3**.\n\nAnd now we're close to the point! This project is an attempt to interpret or even compile **TJS** scripts! And when\nI say **compile**, I mean this project can actually take the **TJS** source code and **translate**\n(**translation** is the valid variant of **compilation** (as long as we can get ELF/EXE binary file at the end)) it\nto **C++**, compile this **C++** source with your system compiler (**clang++** for instance) and link with the tiny\nreplica of **KrKrX**' **TJS** runtime\n\n## Try it out!\n\n**First, you need to have GNU BASH, Python 3, CMake, and CLang compiler installed on your system. Then you can run**  \n```shell\n# This will build PJScript Runtime\nmake runtime\n# This will build 'sample' project\n./pjs.py --project examples/sample\n# This will launch compiled binary\n./examples/sample.sh\n```\n\nAlso, you can simply run `./pjs.sh examples/sample`, but this isn't customizable, script will always run all 3 commands.\n\n## What's the license?\n\n**PJScript** project was initially created in late June 2020 by @jedi2light, and licensed under **WTFPL** public license\n",
