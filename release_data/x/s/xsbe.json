            "description": "# XSBE - XML Schema By Example\n\nXSBE is a novel library intended for *rapid development* of XML related python code.  \n\nIt takes the approach of using lightly annotated example XML documents to act as a schema.  Using these schemas it can \nthen transform an XML document into a more friendly data structures built of dictionaries and lists such as you might \nexpect through parsing json or yaml.\n\nIt's composed of two main libraries:\n - `xsbe.simple_node` Offers a reduced object model for representing XML document *content*.  See [simple_node](simple_node.md)\n - `xsbe.transform` Offers schema definition and transformer components. See [transform](transform.md)\n \n\nCopyright 2020 Philip Couling\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
